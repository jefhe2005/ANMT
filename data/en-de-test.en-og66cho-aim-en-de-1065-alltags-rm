When one einen Lakaien of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided Donald entschied to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.

The interim . vorläufige report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American amerikanischen Shaw military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically typischerweise Frauen provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened Kunstwerk geschehen at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The 10-page report detailed detailliert . persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly : deutlich more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly öffentlich Schutzsuchenden that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains . bleibt under the control of the Islamic State.
The die eine report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly übermäßig Deutschland insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political vereitelten politischen narrative."
Last August, The den sie New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
The investigation has repercussions beyond hinaus im the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But jedoch erhöhen last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The den sind critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W.

U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With mit Türken Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two zwei anpasst goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Here is what she does know: The die Deutschland Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Both finden beiden teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The dem sind first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last letzten , among 12 teams at the London Games.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first erste sie picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
We've made a complete komplett direkt turnaround.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third dritte geht period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left sollen linke side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.

But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic Phase olympischen trampoline.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may möge einer it reign.
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let liegt lassen me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many wie viele I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part teilweise einen because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two bekommen zwei sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish spanischen Amt el trampolín, meaning "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly fast Spitzenkandidaten 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according laut Kanzlerin to the official Olympic program.
But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even Mecklenburger selbst watching the Games.

The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also verzichtet ebenfalls at 1.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely wahrscheinlich so to be overlooked in the general melee.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male sehr männlichen athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent . gewalttätigen resistance by the government.
Witnesses say sagen : that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even sogar Partner harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive Umfragen erhalten as much Western aid.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited der angeführt the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
The die Landesvorsitzende complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two zwei Seen largest ethnic groups.
The der . biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated Sperrung dominiert by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
"The current regime lacks fehlt , that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
Ethiopia's new neuer . prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
The das auch result, many fear, is more bloodshed.
The . der last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new neue Der commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal internen gab resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
While the West clearly wants to support unterstützen ihrem democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
Donald Trump Explains His seine wurden Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried versuchte kundig to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The den zwei clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
The in der post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help gern helfen Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
The der für latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return zurück Rückgang to that subject.
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would würden sind come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.
In late July, after he drew zog schon widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back zurück die as needed.
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one Umsatz eine way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But aber er I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released '' veröffentlicht on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally generell Politik tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand stehen es up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former so ehemaliger New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said sagt die when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try verstehen versuchen to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit ungeeignet es to be president.

The der nicht Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
Mr. Coe's last letztes Koalitionspartner book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Showing some culinary Inhaftierung kulinarische solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
In the years before the Depression, the American Land amerikanischen table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide verstecken bei unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
"It was not a popular beliebter es addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
As never Attentäter niemals before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry die hungernden citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
"He liked mochte : to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually tatsächlich Ansbach got people sick."

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old alt ist
After nach Es being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea.
Greenland sharks swim schwimmt . leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.
The das die five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
It is hard läuft schwer to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around um gibt six degrees Celsius.
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In one einer verhaltener animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They sie Europa use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, contained enthielt . less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday.
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from cosmic kosmische betroffene radiation in the atmosphere.
This konnte das is also a world record for vertebrates.
The der rund previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska.
As a result of low temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often häufig keinerlei run on as little energy as possible.
The hätten die animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters.
"This means that a smaller animal has a more dangerous gefährlicher erfüllen life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist.
