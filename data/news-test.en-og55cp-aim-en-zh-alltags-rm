Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract 交易 agreed with the BMA.
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has 今日 made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
He had told BMA members the 交易 was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but 甚至 higher.
所有 of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
There is 也 an economic motive.
And 甚至 this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, 番茄 back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has 近日 been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.

但是 now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
There are other, smaller brands for 私人 banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its 六 Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.

Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 退役 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and 魅力 have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the 最好 part of 30 years which is great to see.

In remarks to Mr Putin, 引述 on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's 第二 term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
但是 that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.

Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's 北 deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing 竣工 around each of the bridge's three towers.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel 使用 just to build this part of the bridge.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining 缺口 on the north - or landward - side.
This was 完成 by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were 小 - just a few millimetres either way.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full 展示 under the Olympic spotlight.
Biles became the fourth straight American 女子 to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long 旅程 to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes 像 Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of 志向 and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
Anything less than heading back to her family's 家 in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field 旅行 to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final 比分 - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for 第三 but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, 胳膊 and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
The 孩子 was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
No arrests have been made and 警察 are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
She is recovering, and 警察 are still searching for a suspect.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young 女孩 of color.
This team looks, finally, 像 America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina 女性 presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one 女 gymnast has been African-American.
但是 the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
大部分 of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
In September, we will be expanding to 底特律 (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
The 首先 junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.

Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian 角色 and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, 成本 of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.

The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that 警方 should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's 手指 as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Last year a special election 法庭 ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The 法庭 found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of 舞弊 across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting 舞弊 - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the 投票 system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some 族裔 minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
The report, being considered by Theresa May, 也 calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to 防止 anyone voting twice.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal 投票 envelopes.
Give 警方 powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
"The election 法庭 disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, 然而 the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.

China's 火星 program kicks off
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most 能量 efficient to launch the vehicle."
In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the 能力 to find obstacles.
Currently, the Mars has become the 行星 with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a base of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a 第二 home for mankind.
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of 演化 to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc.
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the 火星 atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration.
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with 高 uncertainty.
A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover so that it can 等待 patiently until the departure of dust storms.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the 能源 supply for Mars detection.
This requires that the detector's sun 翼 area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction.
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the 高 speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.
The way to detect the Mars is 相似 to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao.

This toucan, which had its 喙 broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating 葡萄 with a new beak.
In order to remind people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new 喙 color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material.
The 喙 is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's 喙 is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.
Now Gracia can 使用 the new beak to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains.
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with 血 covering on its body.
At that time, its 喙 was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual 喙 is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and 固定 it on its beak with glue."
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken 喙 of Gracia every day to prevent infection.
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal 星球 Channel.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the 崛起 of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots".
Japan's largest oil company JX 能源 believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn." the Cankaoxiaoxi website reported on August 12.
Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the 崛起 of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots".
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, "teapot refineries" generally refine oil from the heavy oil, which has high 硫磺 content and is imported from Russia.
The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high 硫磺 content, which has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refineries" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low 硫磺 contents and have improved the quality of the petroleum products.
Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese 油 companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market".

Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a 游泳 world championship, is not so great.
Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some 挫折 would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image.

Many NBA players have proved their strength. 但是 whenever there is progress, there is a setback.
Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the 公牛 is not so good as that of the Miami Heat.
The backcourt 射程 of he and Rondo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite congested.
Okafor's situation is a bit embarrassing. As the 第一 choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Embiid in the new season.
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Embiid must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a 位置 in the long array of the 76ers remains a question.
Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor came from low position attacks. The 比例 is higher than Cousins, Vukcevic and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's 防守 difficulty.

Snapchat "Anime" 效果 Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a 角色 befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie 朱 said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
Ms. 朱 criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Other observers 分享 her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a 私人 company.

Officials from the United States 中央 Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior 政策 makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States 中央 Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
但 last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
General Austin 退役 in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.

The Depressing 食物 of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," 珍 Ziegelman said.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese 菜 in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American 食品 in the Great Depression.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a 奶油 cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the 夫妻 deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
They were made from an ingredient and a 便宜 thing that stretches the ingredient out.
想象 eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, 尤其 in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for 男 farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
"This was a time when 食物 became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a 奶油 coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with 便宜 dried fruit.
奇怪 mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
"It was not a popular addition to the 晚餐 table," Mr. Coe said.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged 女性 to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
尤其 savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined 像 the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to 吃 Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's 聘用 of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
The legacy is in our continued focus on 卡路里 and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The 夫妻 said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of 食物 waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got 人 sick."
大家 reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped 核桃 would help."

NASA climate model: 金星 was once habitable
金星 was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for 太空 Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less 表面 and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
But the latest simulation suggests 金星 could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
早期 Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
This warms the surface and produces 雨水 that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The model produced a story of 金星 similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, 金星 was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the 金星 we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new 金星 climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
