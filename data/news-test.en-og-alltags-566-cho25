28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
There is also an economic motive.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.

Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.

The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.

Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'

Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past

The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.

During the competition of the that day, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the lower intermediate level and it seemed that she was still quite far away from the final.

China's Mars program kicks off
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."
In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles.
Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a base of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind.
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of evolution to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc.
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration.
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with high uncertainty.
A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover so that it can wait patiently until the departure of dust storms.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection.
This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction.
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.
The way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao.

The new generation of iPhone is really "eye-catching", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has further dampened people's enthusiasm for the new iPhone. "It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation is so terrible."
iPhone7, just like other iPhones, carries countless secrets before birth.
Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of "buying" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will achieve a historical high sales.
Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7.
According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. "The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."
Balance between supply and demand will affect the average users, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time.
Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will surely be brought to users.

This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak.
In order to remind people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material.
The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.
Now Gracia can use the new beak to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains.
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body.
At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual beak is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and fixed it on its beak with glue."
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection.
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots".
Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn." the Cankaoxiaoxi website reported on August 12.
Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots".
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, "teapot refineries" generally refine oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia.
The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content, which has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refineries" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur contents and have improved the quality of the petroleum products.
Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market".

Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the strength of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicated that it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project.
In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.
The stylish appearance of Liu Xuan impressed people and also laid a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle.
After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and set up her own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the 10-meter single match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team.
The once gold generation including Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in various forms of variety show.
And Chen Yibing has become a hoisting ring king while leading his team to win the championship in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.
However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle.
After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a blank state for them in case of capabilities and connection.
Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great.
Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image.
It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.
You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious.

But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extra-long life.
Traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue of animals. Some fins can use fins, but this calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks.

The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark was known as the vertebrate with the longest life span on the Earth, surpassing the age of the previous longevity champion black right whale (211 years).

There was also a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glories for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the newcomers and cultivated a great number of champions.

Many NBA players have proved their strength. But whenever there is progress, there is a setback.
Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Miami Heat.
The backcourt range of he and Rondo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite congested.
Okafor's situation is a bit embarrassing. As the first choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Embiid in the new season.
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Embiid must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of the 76ers remains a question.
Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor came from low position attacks. The ratio is higher than Cousins, Vukcevic and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's defense difficulty.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battle in a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the oil tank of French sports car is not much left.

At the 15th minute, Zhang Xizhe flipped through along a straight line of the midfield. Yilmaz had broken into the penalty area directly and the only defender, Liu Yu, took the lead in kicking the ball away.
Fernando suddenly flipped pass the ball in front of the goal after a retreat in a one-to-two confrontation on his right wing. Kardec was put down by a swoop of Lei Tenglong. The referee sentenced a spot kick and showed a yellow card to Lei Tenglong.
Just at the beginning of the next half, Fernando won a free kick on the right side with an abrupt breakthrough. It was a pity that he kicked the ball too high in small angle and missed the goal.
One minute later, Fernando showed his long-range raid capability on the right again. His pursuer Yu Dabao fouled and also got a yellow card.
Yilmaz made a forceful breakthrough on the penalty area line, but tumbled when Zheng Yourong stretched a leg to stop him, which led the referee to determine a penalty. Yilmaz kicked a successful penalty goal, as a result the score board was: Lifan 2:1 Beijing Guoan.
After the 4-minute allowance, Lifan kept the 2-1 score until the end of the final and defeated Guoan in the visiting field.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
It is a pity that OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high.
On Monday, OPEC President Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry Mohammed Saleh al-Sada said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting at the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
OPEC also said in the monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus aggravating the excessive market supply.
It was April when the oil-producing countries had the last meeting. No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries for relevant meaures.

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.

And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.

The existence of these companies distorted the market signals, reduced the element resources utilization efficiency, increased the cost of social management, thereby hindering the establishment of a market environment based on fair competition.
The main reasons for the loss are the same as the dilemma confronted by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization rate.
China mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law approaches. The government is mainly doing the work of providing primary protection to workers and keeping social stability to ensure a fair and equitable market order.

As the No.12 rookie of the first round in 2014, Saric will officially land on the NBA in the next season, and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, Saric is not known to many fans. But I believe he impressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games.
Since the beginning of this year's Olympic Games, Saric has obtained 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in each of the three games, with a perfect performance.

The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.

Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.

Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
"Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists will wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely." Zheng Jianjun said.
