<nulltag> Spreads </nulltag> between <nulltag> sovereign </nulltag> bonds in Germany and those in other countries were relatively unaffected by political and market uncertainties <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> Greece in late 2014 and early 2015. 
The <nulltag> removal </nulltag> of the floor with respect to the euro was <nulltag> accompanied </nulltag> by a further move into <nulltag> negative </nulltag> territory of the interest rate on sight deposit account balances to -0.75 per cent in order to reduce appreciating pressures and the resulting tightening of monetary conditions. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Thursday, </nulltag> 2 April 2015, at 10.15 a.m. 
Upon <nulltag> instruction </nulltag> from my Government, I have the honour to <nulltag> attach </nulltag> herewith a list containing the names of 96 <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> civilians, including 41 children, killed in Aleppo by terrorist groups during the period from 13 April 2015 to 7 May 2015 (see annex).

For the <nulltag> purposes </nulltag> of the calculation of the coefficient, the withdrawal of Belgium, which <nulltag> becomes </nulltag> <nulltag> effective </nulltag> on 31 December 2015, as well as the accession of the Marshall Islands on 16 March 2015 has already been taken into account and hence 169 countries are included in the calculation. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Adoption </nulltag> of the agenda. 
13. We <nulltag> underscore </nulltag> the need to accelerate <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> at all levels to achieve the objectives of the <nulltag> international </nulltag> arrangement on forests beyond 2015 and the need to establish a stronger, more effective and solid arrangement for the period 2015 to 2030;

6. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> <nulltag> reaffirms </nulltag> that the <nulltag> strict </nulltag> observance of all the provisions of the Treaty remains central to achieving the shared objectives of the total elimination of nuclear weapons, preventing under any circumstances the use and further proliferation of nuclear weapons, and preserving the Treaty's vital contribution to peace and security. 
The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> affirms <nulltag> that, </nulltag> pending the realization of this objective, it is in the interest of the very survival of humanity that <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> weapons never be used again. 
The <nulltag> various </nulltag> <nulltag> training </nulltag> activities are <nulltag> listed </nulltag> in table 2 below. 
The <nulltag> Migration </nulltag> Regulations <nulltag> provide </nulltag> that a person who is or becomes the subject of a resolution of the Security Council which requires Australia to prevent that person entering or transiting through <nulltag> Australian </nulltag> territory is unable to be granted a visa, or, if a visa has already been granted, to have his or her visa cancelled, consistent with the obligations in the relevant Council resolution. 
<nulltag> Underscoring </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS, adopted at the <nulltag> high-level </nulltag> meeting on HIV and AIDS of the General Assembly on 10 June 2011, 
At the 7453rd <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> of the Security Council, <nulltag> held </nulltag> on 29 May 2015, in connection with the Council's consideration of the item entitled "Threats to <nulltag> international </nulltag> peace and security caused by terrorist acts", the President of the Security Council made the following statement on behalf of the Council: 
Upon <nulltag> validation </nulltag> by the board, the programme could be <nulltag> launched </nulltag> on 20 April during the <nulltag> twenty-fifth </nulltag> session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, under the leadership of Finland, with UNEP, the World Green Building Council and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology as co-leads.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Represents </nulltag> the <nulltag> highest </nulltag> authorized strength under Security Council resolution 2124 (2013), with effect from 1 January 2014. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Management Services 
<nulltag> Encouraging </nulltag> the <nulltag> continuation </nulltag> of efforts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the <nulltag> Southern </nulltag> African Development Community (SADC), and the African Union (AU) to restore peace and security in eastern DRC, encouraging the government of the DRC to ensure continuous close cooperation with these and other international parties, and recognizing the efforts of the Government of the DRC aiming at the achievement of peace and national development, 
We <nulltag> urge </nulltag> the <nulltag> States </nulltag> of the <nulltag> "nuclear </nulltag> five" -- which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) -- to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible, which will make it possible to complete the process of formally institutionalizing the zone and to markedly raise the level of mutual trust and security. 
A <nulltag> central </nulltag> <nulltag> element </nulltag> is the deployment of a Quick Reaction Force of one battalion, with vocation to <nulltag> intervene </nulltag> in Liberia as necessary. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> rule </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received letters dated 16 March 2015 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations stating that Ms. Olga Vladimirovna Mozolina and Mr. Egor Sergeevich Shulgin have been appointed alternate representatives of the Russian Federation on the Security Council.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Tuesday, </nulltag> 12 May 2015, at 3 p.m. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> session </nulltag> 
At the same <nulltag> time, </nulltag> a <nulltag> preliminary </nulltag> assessment of "fast-start finance" -- new and additional resources <nulltag> pledged </nulltag> in 2009 by developed countries for climate change mitigation and adaptation during the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -- found that 80 per cent of these flows were also counted as ODA and were paid out with similar modalities, largely through bilateral channels. 
In that <nulltag> context, </nulltag> the <nulltag> Development </nulltag> Cooperation Forum could provide a <nulltag> suitable </nulltag> platform for global mutual accountability while the special high-level meeting could continue to provide a forum for Governments, the major institutional stakeholders, civil society and the business sector to coordinate their implementation efforts in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. 
3. <nulltag> Emphasizes </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of promoting a culture of <nulltag> accountability, </nulltag> results-based management, enterprise risk management and internal control at all levels in the Secretariat through the continued leadership and commitment of senior managers, and reiterates its request that the Secretary-General take appropriate measures to that end, including the training of relevant staff; 
I have the <nulltag> honour, </nulltag> in my capacity as the representative of the <nulltag> current </nulltag> Chairman of the African Union, to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> herewith a press statement adopted on 30 April 2015 by the African Union Peace and Security Council at its 503rd meeting as a follow-up to the communiqué adopted by the African Union Peace and Security Council during its 496th meeting, held on 27 March 2015, on the situation in Western Sahara (see annex). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> statement 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was further <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that, during a mission's liquidation phase, the timelines for write-off and disposal action were <nulltag> reduced </nulltag> in order to meet the end-date of the mandated liquidation period. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste 
It is also <nulltag> important </nulltag> to <nulltag> develop </nulltag> adequate <nulltag> indicators </nulltag> of policy integration, taking into account the work of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in this area. 
<nulltag> Policymaking </nulltag> <nulltag> capacity </nulltag> may be strengthened through the use of <nulltag> problem-solving </nulltag> approaches supported by tool kits and with reference to good practices that can be adapted to a particular context. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> 36 of the terms of reference, the executive summaries of the country review reports finalized by the <nulltag> sixth </nulltag> session will be translated and made available in the six official languages of the United Nations as documents of the Implementation Review Group for information purposes only.

The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> reiterates </nulltag> the gratitude of the Government of Burundi towards the <nulltag> friendly </nulltag> countries and partners that support respect for the laws and institutions of Burundi. 
6. The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of Malaysia has also <nulltag> introduced </nulltag> a <nulltag> special </nulltag> provision in the Securities Commission (Amendment) Bill 2015 in order to grant Securities Commission Malaysia the authority to instruct its licensed intermediaries to freeze the assets or accounts of individuals and entities that may be designated by the Committee. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Tuesday, </nulltag> 28 April 2015, at 10.46 a.m. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> resolutions </nulltag> all support <nulltag> bridging </nulltag> accountability and monitoring through the vehicle of evaluation and lessons learned, including applying lessons learned in programming processes. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> questions: evaluation 
75. Since the 2009 <nulltag> financial </nulltag> <nulltag> crisis, </nulltag> domestic demand has been the main driver of growth in the region, while net exports <nulltag> made </nulltag> a negative contribution to growth between 2010 and 2013. 
It is also increasingly <nulltag> recognized </nulltag> that <nulltag> public </nulltag> <nulltag> investment </nulltag> cuts, the typical shortcut to fiscal consolidation in the region, carry significant long-term economic costs. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> February </nulltag> 
For the <nulltag> peoples </nulltag> of the States members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, 9 May 1945 is a <nulltag> sacred </nulltag> day and one of the most important and <nulltag> respected </nulltag> dates. 
We are eternally <nulltag> indebted </nulltag> to those who <nulltag> fell </nulltag> in the <nulltag> war </nulltag> and we bow our heads before the graves of those who died on the battlefields, of those who were tormented in concentration camps and fascist torture chambers and of those who lost their lives due to famine and hardships. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> relating </nulltag> to information 
<nulltag> Regular </nulltag> <nulltag> meetings </nulltag> via teleconference to <nulltag> coordinate </nulltag> joint planning for major events 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> United Nations system organizations 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> conference </nulltag> will <nulltag> take </nulltag> place under the auspices of the General Secretariat of the Gulf Cooperation Council, upon the request of President Hadi to his counterparts in the Gulf Cooperation Council, of 5 March 2015. 
The <nulltag> Kingdom </nulltag> of Morocco considers totally <nulltag> unacceptable </nulltag> the recent manoeuvring by the African Union in <nulltag> requesting </nulltag> an interaction between its "Special Envoy", Mr. Joaquim Chissano, and the Security Council. 
For its <nulltag> part, </nulltag> the Kingdom of Morocco would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to reiterate, once <nulltag> again, </nulltag> its commitment to the process of political negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. 
<nulltag> c. </nulltag> Training <nulltag> workshops </nulltag> or field trips for journalists to United Nations project sites, in cooperation with the local United Nations system partners, for local journalists in order to promote <nulltag> better </nulltag> understanding of United Nations issues, and organization of training sessions for local United Nations librarians (4). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> is also <nulltag> determined </nulltag> to stem the <nulltag> dangers </nulltag> and horrors of terrorism, with a view to defending the citizens of Syria and their honour and in order to respond to the attack against the capacities of the country and its people. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Wednesday, </nulltag> 18 March 2015, at 10.33 a.m. 
The <nulltag> strengthening </nulltag> of the United States dollar could, however, <nulltag> presage </nulltag> some widening of <nulltag> global </nulltag> imbalances in the outlook period, albeit not to the levels seen during the period 2006-2008. 
With <nulltag> GDP </nulltag> growth <nulltag> slowing, </nulltag> employment growth is <nulltag> declining, </nulltag> while gender gaps are often widening. 
31. In its 2014 <nulltag> resolution </nulltag> <nulltag> entitled </nulltag> "Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of Agency safeguards", the General Conference welcomed, with Brazil's support, the clarifications and <nulltag> additional </nulltag> information provided by the secretariat in the supplementary document. 
<nulltag> Brazil </nulltag> is therefore fully <nulltag> supportive </nulltag> of multilateral efforts <nulltag> aimed </nulltag> at preserving and reinforcing compliance with the non-proliferation obligations of the Treaty, notably through IAEA. 
It is <nulltag> suggested </nulltag> that <nulltag> institutions </nulltag> at all levels will need to undertake adaptations to implement the <nulltag> new </nulltag> development agenda, requiring a fundamental shift in mindsets and attitudes accompanied by strong leadership and vision. 
That <nulltag> shift </nulltag> will <nulltag> need </nulltag> to take the form of engaging in policy dialogue that cut across <nulltag> sectoral </nulltag> or political interests with input from a cross section of groups. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> enclose </nulltag> herewith a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, M. Javad Zarif, regarding the extremely <nulltag> alarming </nulltag> situation in Yemen. 
They have also indiscriminately <nulltag> targeted </nulltag> <nulltag> residential </nulltag> <nulltag> areas, </nulltag> including refugee camps, killing and injuring innocent civilians, in particular women and children. 
25. The <nulltag> Office </nulltag> of Information and Communications Technology will <nulltag> focus </nulltag> on establishing enterprise architecture, will lead the strengthening of Umoja mainstreaming, information security and <nulltag> operational </nulltag> resilience and will ensure that ICT programmes are aligned with the core work of the United Nations. 
10. In <nulltag> order </nulltag> to <nulltag> support </nulltag> the Secretary-General's proposals on how objectives of the Organization, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement, as set out in the <nulltag> biennial </nulltag> programme plan, could be improved to indicate more clearly the impact of the activities implemented, a review of those elements approved for the bienniums 2006-2007 and 2016-2017 was undertaken. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Ms. Kara-Kys Arakchaa 
7. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> the <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> made by the Secretary-General to establish the supply chain module in Umoja, also notes the <nulltag> improved </nulltag> governance of procurement functions to include procurement operations in peacekeeping missions, special political missions, offices away from Headquarters and tribunals while establishing a clear responsibility and accountability framework, and requests the Secretary-General to provide enhanced visibility of information on vendors that are awarded contracts and purchase orders; 
18A.128 During the <nulltag> biennium </nulltag> <nulltag> 2016-2017, </nulltag> <nulltag> projected </nulltag> extrabudgetary resources amounting to $437,100 would provide for one Local level post and will contribute to building the capacities of national statistics offices of Central Africa in the use of modern technologies for the collection and processing of comparable and harmonized statistics. 
The <nulltag> human </nulltag> <nulltag> cost </nulltag> of the illicit transfer, <nulltag> destabilizing </nulltag> accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons 
In the <nulltag> opinion </nulltag> of the Secretary-General, that letter constitutes <nulltag> adequate </nulltag> <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> credentials. 
<nulltag> Important </nulltag> <nulltag> principles </nulltag> that <nulltag> constitute </nulltag> good governance include: stakeholder engagement or participation, fairness, accountability, transparency, efficiency and effectiveness (from Bodegom et al. 2012, An approach for integrating forest governance into national forest-related monitoring systems, FAO Forestry Policy and Institutions Working Paper No. 29, Rome). 
This <nulltag> challenging </nulltag> <nulltag> situation </nulltag> points to the need for renewed negotiations with <nulltag> international </nulltag> financial institutions, primarily IMF, on a new financial arrangement, or the identification of alternative sources of financing, which are likely to be either difficult to obtain or far less favourable. 
The <nulltag> order </nulltag> <nulltag> specified </nulltag> that it should apply especially to decisions regarding <nulltag> new </nulltag> appointments and hiring. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the participation of United Nations and indigenous experts in the panel discussion on the proposed indigenous peoples development index. 
5. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum <nulltag> recommends </nulltag> that the Statistics Division actively engage with indigenous peoples in <nulltag> developed </nulltag> countries and, in particular, developing countries, including indigenous women, indigenous young people and indigenous people with disabilities, in developing key indicators on indigenous peoples, including for data disaggregation, to be included in the overall indicators for the post-2015 development agenda to be adopted in March 2016. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> rule </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received credentials signed on 8 May 2015 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand stating that Mr. Gerardus Jacobus van Bohemen has been appointed representative of New Zealand on the Security Council. 
<nulltag> Payments </nulltag> <nulltag> received </nulltag> as at the same date amounted to $1,036,201,000, leaving an <nulltag> outstanding </nulltag> balance of $40,762,000. 
During this <nulltag> first </nulltag> <nulltag> visit, </nulltag> which <nulltag> coincided </nulltag> with the opening of the Bangui Forum, I held discussions with representatives of the civil society and the international community based in Bangui as well as with the transitional authorities, to seek their views on the priority aspects for the engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission in the Central African Republic, at a crucial junction of the political process. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> my <nulltag> capacity </nulltag> as Chair of the Central African Republic configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission, I <nulltag> visited </nulltag> Bangui from 2 to 5 May 2015. 
At the <nulltag> end </nulltag> of February, LJM split and <nulltag> formed </nulltag> two <nulltag> new </nulltag> political parties, one led by the former Chair of LJM, Tijani al-Sissi, the other by Secretary Bahar Idriss Abu Garda. 
As at 7 <nulltag> May </nulltag> 2015, unpaid assessed contributions to the UNAMID Special Account amounted to <nulltag> $263.9 </nulltag> million, while the <nulltag> total </nulltag> outstanding assessed contributions for all peacekeeping operations amounted to $1,958.6 million. 
<nulltag> Reiterating </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> for the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community to implement all commitments regarding the economic and social development of Africa, 
55. Upon enquiry, the <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee was <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that no bank charges were collected in 2014 by the <nulltag> service-providing </nulltag> bank pending the conclusion of the negotiation for an agreement, which has recently been reached, effective February 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Sectors </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Mission </nulltag> mandates, in <nulltag> particular </nulltag> on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security sector reform, should be <nulltag> designed </nulltag> on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of short-, medium- and long-term security needs. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Consistent </nulltag> <nulltag> application </nulltag> of the robust International Ammunition Technical Guidelines is essential. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> police </nulltag> officer who <nulltag> seizes </nulltag> property is the administrator of that property (s. 255, POCA). 
<nulltag> Sections </nulltag> 251, 252, 254, 258 and 261-265 of POCA provide for production or <nulltag> monitoring </nulltag> orders against property under <nulltag> certain </nulltag> conditions to prevent the dealing or disposal of the property, as well as search and seizure of suspected tainted or other property under a search warrant, or without in emergencies. 
The <nulltag> dates </nulltag> <nulltag> given </nulltag> for each item indicate when the item was first taken up by the Council at a formal meeting, and the most <nulltag> recent </nulltag> formal meeting of the Council held on that item. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> No two <nulltag> members </nulltag> of the Commission shall be nationals of the same State. 
<nulltag> Report </nulltag> of the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> the credentials of the representative of Chile on the Security Council 
2. During the <nulltag> World </nulltag> Conference, States also <nulltag> reiterated </nulltag> their commitment to address disaster risk reduction and the building of resilience to disasters with a renewed sense of urgency within the context of <nulltag> sustainable </nulltag> development and poverty eradication, and to integrate, as appropriate, both disaster risk reduction and the building of resilience into policies, plans, programmes and budgets at all levels and to consider both within relevant frameworks. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of UNMIS as at 30 June 2014 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Consideration </nulltag> of the submission <nulltag> made </nulltag> by Uruguay. 
<nulltag> Accordingly, </nulltag> I <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to inform you that, after consulting with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2206 (2015) concerning South Sudan, I have appointed the <nulltag> following </nulltag> experts: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have <nulltag> designated </nulltag> <nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Vladimir Zhagora to serve as Coordinator of the Panel of Experts. 
The <nulltag> Islamic </nulltag> Republic of Iran has always <nulltag> supported </nulltag> the United <nulltag> Nations-led </nulltag> efforts in restoring peace and stability in Yemen and fully abides by its strong commitment to the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Yemen. 
It <nulltag> stokes </nulltag> and exacerbates the <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> <nulltag> conflict </nulltag> in the country, and, if unchecked, will turn it into a protracted torment. 
In our <nulltag> view, </nulltag> in order to <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> <nulltag> sufficient </nulltag> time for all the considerations, now is the time to start the process. 
In order to <nulltag> access </nulltag> <nulltag> documents, </nulltag> a court order is <nulltag> needed. </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Money-laundering, </nulltag> <nulltag> concealment </nulltag> (arts. 23 and 24) 
The <nulltag> weak </nulltag> economic <nulltag> prospects </nulltag> of European economies <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to hamper non-oil exports from the region, especially the Maghreb countries. 
1. The <nulltag> world </nulltag> economy <nulltag> witnessed </nulltag> shifts in <nulltag> several </nulltag> important features in 2014. 
Nor are <nulltag> human </nulltag> <nulltag> resources </nulltag> <nulltag> allotted </nulltag> strategically for dissemination purposes. 
<nulltag> Underlining, </nulltag> <nulltag> therefore, </nulltag> the necessity to take measures to safeguard and protect the <nulltag> tangible </nulltag> and intangible heritage of communities against the effects of armed conflict at all times, 
7445th <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> <nulltag> held </nulltag> on 19 <nulltag> May </nulltag> 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Draganov </nulltag> will <nulltag> succeed </nulltag> Mr. Miroslav Jenča (Slovakia). 
<nulltag> Following </nulltag> the <nulltag> usual </nulltag> <nulltag> consultations, </nulltag> I wish to inform you of my intention to appoint Mr. Petko Draganov (Bulgaria) as my Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia in Ashgabat. 
<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the 7407th meeting of the Security Council

A <nulltag> referral </nulltag> to the <nulltag> Court </nulltag> would <nulltag> deter </nulltag> future war crimes and bring justice to victims across Syria. 
<nulltag> Physicians </nulltag> for Human Rights has <nulltag> found </nulltag> that <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> regime forces are responsible for 97 per cent of medical personnel deaths throughout the past four years and 88 per cent of deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on medical facilities. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> items 68 (c) and 107 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have <nulltag> designated </nulltag> <nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Hugh Griffiths to serve as Coordinator of the Panel of Experts. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> refer </nulltag> to Security Council resolution 2207 (2015), by which the Council decided to extend until 5 April 2016 the mandate of the Panel of Experts, as specified in paragraph 26 of resolution 1874 (2009), and requested me to take the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> administrative measures to that effect. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> item 163 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations Development Assistance Framework results matrices are also <nulltag> available </nulltag> through the UNICEF Executive Board <nulltag> website. </nulltag> 
7. The <nulltag> Secretariat </nulltag> will <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to brief States Parties in The Hague on the <nulltag> aforementioned </nulltag> destruction activities. 
As the <nulltag> destruction </nulltag> at Veolia ES is currently on hold <nulltag> pending </nulltag> the resolution of <nulltag> technical </nulltag> issues, an accurate forecast about its completion date cannot be provided at this time. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> rule </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received a letter dated 27 May 2015 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations stating that Mr. Mark Sedwill will represent the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 7453rd meeting of the Security Council, to be held on 29 May 2015.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Netherlands </nulltag> has <nulltag> contributed </nulltag> a total of Euro475,000 to the IAEA in order for it to verify the implementation of the Joint Plan of Action. 
With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to the finalization of the <nulltag> first </nulltag> cycle, several States <nulltag> stated </nulltag> that an end-of-cycle product would be required. 
The <nulltag> practice </nulltag> of <nulltag> convening </nulltag> <nulltag> donor </nulltag> meetings or holding specific discussions on technical assistance during the direct dialogue was also noted as useful. 
It is <nulltag> clear </nulltag> that the continued <nulltag> presence </nulltag> of such a gap in the commitments within and outside the Treaty <nulltag> reflects </nulltag> negatively on both its nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives. 
In <nulltag> order </nulltag> to <nulltag> address </nulltag> the gap, it is <nulltag> crucial </nulltag> to take progressive measures to restrict and prevent cooperation with such States in accordance with terms identified under the Treaty and under the relevant decisions of Review Conferences in that regard. 
In <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with rule 55 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the following communiqué was <nulltag> issued </nulltag> through the Secretary-General in place of a verbatim record: 
34. <nulltag> Subject </nulltag> to its <nulltag> observations </nulltag> and recommendations <nulltag> contained </nulltag> in paragraph 23 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for civilian personnel. 
<nulltag> Concerning </nulltag> the transfer of technology, the <nulltag> United </nulltag> States supports a <nulltag> broad </nulltag> range of initiatives and mechanisms that provide technical assistance, including through the transfer of technology, to developing countries.

The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> of the Parties may <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to adopt a decision along the <nulltag> following </nulltag> lines: 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to section D of the terms of reference, which <nulltag> refers </nulltag> to ENFORCE membership, the Conference of the Parties is to elect five party representatives and designate five representatives of the Basel Convention <nulltag> regional </nulltag> and coordinating centres at each of its meetings. 
<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the 7403rd meeting of the Security Council 
Throughout the <nulltag> fighting </nulltag> in Khuza'a, IDF commanders on the ground had <nulltag> received </nulltag> <nulltag> numerous </nulltag> indications that the school compound was being used as an observation post and a command and control centre. 
UNRWA <nulltag> called </nulltag> the <nulltag> Coordination </nulltag> and Liaison Administration, stating that UNRWA would not be evacuating the residents and recalling that the school was a <nulltag> civilian </nulltag> object. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> rule </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received a letter dated 27 May 2015 from the Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations stating that Mr. Christopher Finlayson, Attorney General, will represent New Zealand at the 7453rd meeting of the Security Council, to be held on 29 May 2015. 
On <nulltag> June </nulltag> 25 and September 20, 2014, Iraq <nulltag> wrote </nulltag> to the Security Council, making <nulltag> clear </nulltag> that it was facing a serious threat of continuing attacks from Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) emanating from safe havens in Syria. 
The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of Iraq <nulltag> asked </nulltag> the United States to lead <nulltag> international </nulltag> efforts to strike ISIL sites and military strongholds in Syria in order to end the continuing attacks on Iraq, to protect Iraqi citizens, and ultimately to enable Iraqi forces to regain control of Iraq's borders. 
23. <nulltag> Citing </nulltag> <nulltag> rocket </nulltag> attacks launched in June 2014 into Israel from Gaza, in July Israel launched its <nulltag> deadliest </nulltag> offensive against the Gaza Strip since its occupation in 1967.

The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> stresses that <nulltag> peacekeeping </nulltag> operations need to be complemented with activities aimed at effectively improving the living conditions of the affected populations, including quick implementation of highly effective and visible projects that help to create jobs and deliver basic social services in the postconflict phase. 
The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> Committee also <nulltag> notes </nulltag> with appreciation the efforts to update training programmes and materials, all of which are <nulltag> critical </nulltag> to ensuring that there is an effective and comprehensive response, including preventive measures, with respect to child protection. 
On 25 <nulltag> May </nulltag> 2015, an air strike <nulltag> conducted </nulltag> by the coalition led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hit close to the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Sana'a, causing <nulltag> severe </nulltag> damage to the building and property of the Embassy.

<nulltag> Good </nulltag> <nulltag> governance, </nulltag> effective institutions, peace and stability are <nulltag> found </nulltag> to be both enablers and outcomes of development, and taking into account this interconnection will be of great importance for implementation of the post-2015 development agenda. 
Among the <nulltag> different </nulltag> <nulltag> dimensions </nulltag> of gender equality, economic empowerment <nulltag> appears </nulltag> to have a central role. 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> <nulltag> MINUSCA </nulltag> <nulltag> started </nulltag> to engage with potential partners for the reintegration phase. 
The <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> <nulltag> demonstrated </nulltag> continuing <nulltag> international </nulltag> support to the transition process and recognized progress made by the Transitional Authorities to advance the political process, but did not result in new pledges to bridge significant gaps in funding for the electoral process or to support the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.

<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> the <nulltag> indispensable </nulltag> <nulltag> role </nulltag> of crime prevention and criminal justice responses in combating all forms and aspects of trafficking in cultural property and related offences in a comprehensive and effective manner, 
13. <nulltag> Encourages </nulltag> States that are not already parties to <nulltag> consider </nulltag> ratifying or acceding to relevant <nulltag> legal </nulltag> instruments, in particular the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property; 
The <nulltag> Director </nulltag> General <nulltag> assumes </nulltag> that, for the <nulltag> 2016-2017 </nulltag> biennium, most Member States will continue to meet their obligations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the Director, Evaluation Office 
To that <nulltag> end, </nulltag> we <nulltag> participate </nulltag> in <nulltag> multilateral, </nulltag> regional and bilateral initiatives that have the political aim of finding mechanisms for discussion and analysis to achieve the objective of a nuclear-weapon-free world. 
5. <nulltag> Chile </nulltag> is an <nulltag> active </nulltag> member of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI), which <nulltag> aims </nulltag> to implement the plan of action proposed at the most recent Conference of the Parties.

11. UNICEF <nulltag> management </nulltag> notes that of the 39 audit reports of UNICEF offices and functions <nulltag> issued </nulltag> in 2014, 3 had an <nulltag> overall </nulltag> `unqualified' rating (indicating fully satisfactory controls) and 22 had a `moderately qualified' rating. 
<nulltag> Such </nulltag> <nulltag> trauma </nulltag> can <nulltag> lead </nulltag> to desperation and hopelessness, with indigenous communities frequently seeing suicide rates that are significantly higher than among the general population. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum: 
The <nulltag> Sultanate </nulltag> of Oman is <nulltag> committed </nulltag> to implementing Security Council resolution 2140 (2014) and has taken all steps <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> to implement effectively the measures imposed by paragraph 11 (asset freeze) and paragraph 15 (travel ban) of the above-mentioned resolution. 
With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to the ceremony, I <nulltag> intend </nulltag> to move it to coincide with the peacekeeping summit to be held in September 2015, in the context of the <nulltag> seventieth </nulltag> anniversary of the United Nations, to elevate the profile of the Medal and, by extension, to honour the work of the military, police and civilian United Nations personnel and associated personnel in the service of humanity. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> absence </nulltag> of a response from the Security Council, I have <nulltag> proceeded </nulltag> with the implementation of resolution 2154 (2014) along the lines of my letter of 16 December 2014 and requested nominations from all United Nations field missions. 
In <nulltag> terms </nulltag> of internet searches <nulltag> (para. </nulltag> 114 of the <nulltag> final </nulltag> evaluation report), Google trends (figure 6) or citations in papers (table 7, the evaluation credits the HDR well ahead of similar publications, particularly the World Development Report. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 6 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> agenda 
The <nulltag> office </nulltag> <nulltag> seeks </nulltag> to nurture and sustain an <nulltag> organizational </nulltag> culture committed to ethics and accountability, with the aim of enhancing both the credibility and the effectiveness of the United Nations. 
This <nulltag> function </nulltag> <nulltag> serves </nulltag> to prevent, mitigate and resolve <nulltag> actual </nulltag> or perceived conflicts of interest, and in so doing enhances the integrity of UNOPS and its personnel. 
The <nulltag> Council </nulltag> has been <nulltag> interested </nulltag> in this project since 1982, <nulltag> following </nulltag> the decision taken by the Governments of Morocco and Spain within the framework of a bilateral agreement on cooperation adopted on 24 October 1980 for the joint study of the feasibility of the project. 
15. <nulltag> On-site </nulltag> <nulltag> inspections </nulltag> are <nulltag> provided </nulltag> for in the Treaty as a final verification measure. 
The <nulltag> radionuclide </nulltag> station in Ussuriysk, Russia, <nulltag> reported </nulltag> a <nulltag> similar </nulltag> detection at a lower level. 
5. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum <nulltag> highlights </nulltag> the <nulltag> unprincipled </nulltag> positions and actions of States that undermine indigenous peoples' human rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and that such conduct prejudices indigenous peoples globally and serves to weaken the international human rights system. 
25. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> in this context the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> progress in the development of the Afghan National Army and its improved ability to plan and undertake operations, and encourages <nulltag> sustained </nulltag> training efforts, including through the contribution of trainers, resources and Advisory Teams through the NATO Resolute Support Mission, and advice in developing a sustainable defence planning process as well as assistance in defence reform initiatives; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Decides </nulltag> to <nulltag> extend </nulltag> until 17 March 2016 the mandate of UNAMA, as defined in its resolutions 1662 (2006), 1746 (2007), 1806 (2008), 1868 (2009), 1917 (2010), 1974 (2011), 2041 (2012), 2096 (2013) and 2145 (2014), and paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 below; 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was also <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that the proposal would enhance the ability of the proposed service to shift from a <nulltag> traditional </nulltag> approach to public information to a proactive approach that leverages an analysis of stakeholder perceptions and strategic forward planning to communicate messages that build support, dispel misconceptions and manage expectations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the United States has not produced highly <nulltag> enriched </nulltag> uranium (HEU) for weapons since 1964 or produced plutonium for weapons since 1988. 
Both <nulltag> dimensions </nulltag> <nulltag> need </nulltag> to be included in the <nulltag> new </nulltag> accountability system and monitored by the Secretariat to ensure impartiality in the light of power imbalances. 
Those <nulltag> national </nulltag> and regional <nulltag> processes </nulltag> would then <nulltag> converge </nulltag> at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development which has been mandated by the General Assembly to provide political leadership and review implementation of sustainable development commitments. 
Further <nulltag> aerial </nulltag> <nulltag> bombings </nulltag> are <nulltag> alleged </nulltag> to have occurred on 23 March and 6 April in Delieba, Raga County, and on 8 and 9 April in Nyinbouli and Achana in Aweil West County and Mayom Angok in Aweil North County. 
One <nulltag> incident </nulltag> <nulltag> remains </nulltag> to be <nulltag> verified. </nulltag> 
While the <nulltag> global </nulltag> <nulltag> demand </nulltag> for reactor fuel is <nulltag> met </nulltag> through the international nuclear fuel market, establishing additional fuel assurance mechanisms, such as international fuel banks, reinforces confidence and diversifies supply. 
25. <nulltag> Expresses </nulltag> its <nulltag> gratitude </nulltag> to the International Organization of la Francophonie for the steps it has taken in <nulltag> recent </nulltag> years to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and dialogue between cultures and civilizations, and encourages the United Nations and the International Organization of la Francophonie to cooperate more closely to ensure full respect for provisions on multilingualism; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> behalf </nulltag> of the people of Syria, I <nulltag> therefore </nulltag> ask that members of the Security Council work without delay: 
<nulltag> ISIL </nulltag> extremists have <nulltag> killed </nulltag> <nulltag> innocent </nulltag> children, detained women and children, kidnapped medical workers and beheaded those who dared to defend civilians trapped inside the camp.

<nulltag> Determining </nulltag> that the <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in South Sudan continues to constitute a threat to <nulltag> international </nulltag> peace and security in the region, 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> rule </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received a letter dated 28 May 2015 from the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations stating that Mr. Francisco Martinez Vazquez will represent Spain at the 7453rd meeting of the Security Council, to be held on 29 May 2015. 
<nulltag> According </nulltag> to one <nulltag> speaker, </nulltag> <nulltag> non-permanent </nulltag> members had sought such an arrangement a decade previously. 
The <nulltag> practice </nulltag> of <nulltag> political </nulltag> coordinators <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> regularly as a group was well established, as were relations among permanent representatives. 
The <nulltag> DPRK </nulltag> Government is of the view that the Security Council should <nulltag> consider </nulltag> the issue of the US-south Korea <nulltag> joint </nulltag> military exercises as a root cause of the vicious cycle of aggravating the situation on the Korean Peninsula as well as a grave threat to the maintenance of international peace and security. 
These <nulltag> US-south </nulltag> Korea <nulltag> joint </nulltag> military exercises were the real nuclear war games of aggression which <nulltag> mobilized </nulltag> all kinds of the latest strategic nuclear strike means with the purpose of occupying Pyongyang, the capital of the DPRK, in order to remove the leadership of the DPRK. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> it is <nulltag> surprising </nulltag> that the only reports of insurgency concern four districts in the province of Bujumbura Mairie: Musaga, in the commune of Muha, Cibitoke and Ngagara, in the commune of Ntahangwa, and Nyakabiga, in the commune of Mukaza. 
I <nulltag> ask </nulltag> the <nulltag> competent </nulltag> <nulltag> judicial </nulltag> authorities to treat this as an urgent matter so that the people of Burundi and the international community may know the truth and so that the guilty parties, once identified, may be punished in accordance with the law.

3. <nulltag> Stresses </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the <nulltag> programmatic </nulltag> coherence of the Joint Programme to continue to leverage the comparative advantages of diverse United Nations bodies and partners in strengthening a multisectoral response to HIV and AIDS; 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> rule </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received a letter dated 27 May 2015 from the General Services Officer of the Permanent Mission of the United States of America to the United Nations stating that Mr. Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security, will represent the United States of America at the 7453rd meeting of the Security Council, to be held on 29 May 2015.

<nulltag> Objective </nulltag> of the Organization: To <nulltag> strengthen </nulltag> <nulltag> regional </nulltag> cooperation and integration in line with the development priorities of the East and North-East Asian subregion in order to accelerate progress towards attainment of internationally agreed development goals and to achieve inclusive and sustainable development

Also in 2014, the <nulltag> Palestine </nulltag> Liberation Organization and Hamas <nulltag> reached </nulltag> a deal to end their <nulltag> political </nulltag> division since 2007 and form a national consensus government, thus putting Gaza and the Palestinian-controlled areas in the West Bank under a single administration. 
The <nulltag> annual </nulltag> <nulltag> report </nulltag> for 2014 of the procurement review body, which was <nulltag> published </nulltag> on 9 March, cited 537 cases of violation of the law, including irregularities in bid evaluations, decisions on bid winners, tender dossiers and technical requirements, as well as unequal treatment of bidders. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> expects </nulltag> that all efforts will be made to prevent the recurrence of such delays in the renewal or rebidding of air charter contracts for peacekeeping operations that might cause <nulltag> material </nulltag> loss to the Organization.

<nulltag> Noting </nulltag> that marking and tracing of <nulltag> small </nulltag> arms and light <nulltag> weapons </nulltag> by Member States, particularly countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, can serve to detect violations of applicable arms embargoes and identify weaknesses in stockpile management,

The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs of Georgia <nulltag> condemns </nulltag> the signing of the socalled "treaty", which is directed against the sovereignty and <nulltag> territorial </nulltag> integrity of Georgia and, as in the case of Georgia's Abkhazia region -- constitutes a factual annexation of the occupied Tskhinvali region of Georgia. 
We <nulltag> commit </nulltag> ourselves to <nulltag> holistic </nulltag> and comprehensive <nulltag> approaches </nulltag> to countering crime, violence, corruption and terrorism in all their forms and manifestations, and to ensuring that those responses are implemented in a coordinated and coherent way, along with broader programmes or measures for social and economic development, poverty eradication, respect for cultural diversity, social peace and social inclusion.

The <nulltag> entry </nulltag> into force in December 2014 of the Arms Trade Treaty, which <nulltag> includes </nulltag> small arms and light weapons in its scope and contains provisions on ammunition, further raised the level of attention and <nulltag> scrutiny </nulltag> given to controls over small arms and light weapons. 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> the Committee remains <nulltag> concerned </nulltag> that there may be <nulltag> potential </nulltag> conflicts of interest because UNDP undertakes some of the administrative functions for UN-Women through other service level agreements, such as for information and communications technology systems and the administration of payroll, benefits and entitlements.

The <nulltag> transfer </nulltag> of knowledge and responsibilities from the Umoja team to the <nulltag> corresponding </nulltag> organizational areas within the Secretariat as part of mainstreaming will <nulltag> continue </nulltag> and jointly managed by the process owners and the Chief Information Technology Officer.

<nulltag> High </nulltag> <nulltag> alert </nulltag> levels are incompatible with the commitments <nulltag> entered </nulltag> into by all States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reduce the role of nuclear weapons and to take concrete steps towards their eventual elimination.

It should be <nulltag> noted </nulltag> that it will not be <nulltag> possible </nulltag> to complete the liquidation <nulltag> process </nulltag> of the Tribunal within one month and, as such, it is anticipated that some liquidation work will spill over into 2016. 
For <nulltag> example, </nulltag> international <nulltag> airline </nulltag> operators may be <nulltag> faced </nulltag> with the choice between refusing to transmit passenger data, in violation of the requirements of API laws of the departure or destination country, or providing the data, in breach of the data protection requirements of the departure or destination country.

Only the <nulltag> irreversible </nulltag> <nulltag> reductions </nulltag> of nuclear weapons can <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> that re-deployment will not be possible. 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> the Republic of Korea welcomes <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> efforts by the five Nuclear Weapon States, in particular the regular Conferences <nulltag> held </nulltag> among them during this review cycle.

There is every <nulltag> reason </nulltag> to <nulltag> believe </nulltag> that the chemical agent used against <nulltag> innocent </nulltag> civilians in Idlib governorate was chlorine gas. 
If the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council is <nulltag> serious </nulltag> about <nulltag> stopping </nulltag> future atrocities and ensuring accountability, then it must instruct the fact-finding mission to determine responsibility for the chlorine gas attacks.

The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in Yarmouk is one of <nulltag> extreme </nulltag> deprivation and desperation, fear and trauma, <nulltag> affecting </nulltag> every man, woman and child in the camp. 
<nulltag> Humanitarian </nulltag> <nulltag> needs </nulltag> are massive and are <nulltag> growing </nulltag> by the day. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> will <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to monitor how its <nulltag> various </nulltag> recommendations are adopted in UNFPA. 
<nulltag> UNFPA </nulltag> management <nulltag> informed </nulltag> the Committee that a review will be carried out in 2015 to study the assurance structures and audit cycles of other sister agencies and by taking into account the <nulltag> collective </nulltag> oversight structures in UNFPA. 
9. In its <nulltag> review </nulltag> of the <nulltag> six-month </nulltag> interim resource requirements for UNAMA for 2015, the Advisory Committee <nulltag> questioned </nulltag> the criteria on which the Secretary-General had based his decision not to submit a full budget proposal for UNAMA for 2015.

The <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations Mine Action Service <nulltag> surveyed </nulltag> and cleared all UNRWA schools and 21 government schools of <nulltag> explosive </nulltag> remnants of war, allowing more than 250,000 children to return safely to school.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the resolutions of the United Nations 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> parties </nulltag> to the conflict <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to restrict access to besieged areas in April, with no United Nations assistance reaching any besieged area during the month. 
2. The <nulltag> information </nulltag> <nulltag> contained </nulltag> herein is based on the data <nulltag> available </nulltag> to United Nations agencies on the ground and reports from the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and from open sources. 
They are <nulltag> expected </nulltag> to begin their <nulltag> deployment </nulltag> during the course of the <nulltag> current </nulltag> month. 
I am <nulltag> pleased </nulltag> to <nulltag> inform </nulltag> you of the <nulltag> progress </nulltag> made in implementing the decision of the Security Council. 
It also <nulltag> expresses </nulltag> <nulltag> concern </nulltag> at the abduction of <nulltag> Lebanese </nulltag> soldiers by ISIL, also known as Daesh, and Jahbat al Nusra and calls for their immediate release. 
It <nulltag> underscores </nulltag> its <nulltag> concern </nulltag> at the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> cross-border fire and shelling from the Syrian Arab Republic into Lebanon, which has caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, as well as incursions, abductions, and arms trafficking across the Lebanese-Syrian border. 
In <nulltag> drawing </nulltag> your <nulltag> attention </nulltag> to the statement, I would like to point out that the Republic of Serbia has consistently supported the <nulltag> above-mentioned </nulltag> values and principles, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and set forth in European standards, and fully expects that they will be respected by other countries of the region as well. 
I am <nulltag> obliged </nulltag> to draw your <nulltag> attention </nulltag> to the statement made by Mr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, in a <nulltag> joint </nulltag> interview with Mr. Hashim Thaçi on Priština Television, on Monday, 6 April 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> for Sustainable Human Development 
<nulltag> Observers </nulltag> for other States Members of the United Nations and for <nulltag> non-member </nulltag> States, representatives of organizations of the United Nations system and observers for intergovernmental, non-governmental and other organizations also <nulltag> attended. </nulltag>

42. Through its <nulltag> provision </nulltag> of analysis and promotion of dialogue, ECLAC <nulltag> assisted </nulltag> member States in developing and articulating a <nulltag> unified </nulltag> voice in global policymaking processes. 
<nulltag> Focusing </nulltag> on planning for <nulltag> urbanization, </nulltag> including adequate <nulltag> rules </nulltag> and regulations and a viable financial plan, is a realistic and precautionary strategy for the future. 
<nulltag> Enhancing </nulltag> the <nulltag> interaction </nulltag> between <nulltag> urban </nulltag> and rural areas therefore requires adequate governance arrangements (i.e., recognizing and negotiating both the formal and informal) and adequate capacity (i.e., institutional, human and system-related). 
<nulltag> Other </nulltag> <nulltag> matters </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> we <nulltag> launched </nulltag> <nulltag> Operation </nulltag> Restoring Hope, which we hope will help to bring together all brothers and friends in the effort to achieve stability and will pave the way for the start of development work in Yemen. 
<nulltag> Headquarters, </nulltag> <nulltag> regional </nulltag> service centres and UNDP country offices are <nulltag> providing </nulltag> the technical support needed for the preparation of these reports, upon demand. 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> my Government would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to recall that it was following the refusal of MONUSCO to work with the two generals appointed to command the operations against FDLR and to assist FARDC in those operations that the Government, noting that decision, and wishing to fulfil its obligations with regard to neutralizing the <nulltag> negative </nulltag> forces, was obliged to initiate the current operations against FDLR without the assistance of MONUSCO. 
Despite the efforts <nulltag> made, </nulltag> including efforts to <nulltag> re-establish </nulltag> <nulltag> dialogue </nulltag> with MONUSCO, my Government notes with regret that, contrary to expectations, no progress has been made by the United Nations on reaching consensus so that concrete proposals can be made to the Security Council. 
I have the <nulltag> honour, </nulltag> in my capacity as representative of the <nulltag> current </nulltag> Chair of the African Union, to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> herewith a letter dated 30 March 2015 from the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, forwarding a communiqué on the situation in Western Sahara adopted by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union at its 496th meeting, held in Addis Ababa on 27 March 2015, as well as the related report (see annex).

<nulltag>  </nulltag> protection 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> General </nulltag> Assembly, 
1. <nulltag> We, </nulltag> the Heads of State and Government, ministers and delegates <nulltag> participating </nulltag> in the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, have gathered from 14 to 18 March 2015 in Sendai City of Miyagi Prefecture in Japan, which has demonstrated a <nulltag> vibrant </nulltag> recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. 
<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> the increasing <nulltag> impact </nulltag> of disasters and their complexity in <nulltag> many </nulltag> parts of the world, we declare our determination to enhance our efforts to strengthen disaster risk reduction to reduce losses of lives and assets from disasters worldwide. 
6. <nulltag> Many </nulltag> <nulltag> representatives </nulltag> <nulltag> focused </nulltag> on multilingualism in the work of the Department, including the use of the six official languages across social and new media platforms. 
18. <nulltag> Responding </nulltag> to <nulltag> comments </nulltag> and queries, the <nulltag> Under-Secretary-General </nulltag> for Communications and Public Information emphasized the Department's commitment to multilingualism, saying that it was factored into all planning and decision-making to ensure that the Department reached as broad an audience as possible. 
The <nulltag> food </nulltag> deliveries were <nulltag> accompanied </nulltag> by WFP-supplied <nulltag> nutritional </nulltag> supplies for 1,197 children. 
70. I am also <nulltag> appalled </nulltag> at the <nulltag> collective </nulltag> <nulltag> punishment </nulltag> being meted out to people in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
5. <nulltag> Decides </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee, </nulltag> in accordance with its mandate, shall continue its efforts for a comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects and shall review the implementation of its previous proposals and consider any new proposals so as to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil its responsibilities in this field; 
<nulltag> Bearing </nulltag> in <nulltag> mind </nulltag> the <nulltag> continuous </nulltag> necessity of preserving the efficiency and strengthening the effectiveness of the work of the Special Committee, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> view </nulltag> of the foregoing, and <nulltag> taking </nulltag> into account the proposed staffing changes, the Committee recommends the application of a vacancy rate of 24 per cent for United Nations Volunteers. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> changes were <nulltag> made </nulltag> to improve format and to allow for online updates 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Proposed </nulltag> action 
<nulltag> Speakers </nulltag> <nulltag> supported </nulltag> <nulltag> closer </nulltag> collaboration on a range of matters and through different means, and encouraged further harmonization and coordination among the functional commissions on themes and issues. 
<nulltag> Secretariats </nulltag> of <nulltag> functional </nulltag> commissions also <nulltag> needed </nulltag> to provide the necessary support to the commissions. 
2. The Credentials Committee <nulltag> failed </nulltag> to ask the <nulltag> imposters </nulltag> to produce the <nulltag> required </nulltag> accreditation documents, which must bear the seal and signature of the Head of State or Government or of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or to provide copies pending the provision of original documents bearing a true seal and signature to the Credentials Committee of the Congress. 
In addition, the <nulltag> Polish </nulltag> <nulltag> Criminal </nulltag> Code <nulltag> provides </nulltag> for criminal sanctions against any person who, in violation of international law, produces, stockpiles, acquires, sells or transports weapons of mass destruction (including nuclear weapons) or other means of combat or conducts research aimed at producing or using such weapons. 
We are <nulltag> ready </nulltag> to <nulltag> participate </nulltag> in developing the technical <nulltag> solutions </nulltag> to this process. 
3. <nulltag> Article </nulltag> 2, paragraph 2, of annex II to the Convention <nulltag> provides </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> shall prepare a list in alphabetical order of all persons thus nominated and shall submit it to all the States parties. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> York, 8-12 June 2015 
For <nulltag> instance, </nulltag> how would the <nulltag> pledge </nulltag> feed into international processes such as that those <nulltag> related </nulltag> to the NPT? 
19. Some <nulltag> participants </nulltag> <nulltag> argued </nulltag> that timeframes remained <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> for the outcome document. 
The 12 <nulltag> victims </nulltag> <nulltag> present </nulltag> at the site -- including 2 children -- <nulltag> suffered </nulltag> symptoms including suffocation and required immediate medical attention.

<nulltag> Temporary </nulltag> special <nulltag> measures </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> National </nulltag> Space Agency under the authority of the President of Turkmenistan, <nulltag> established </nulltag> in 2011 by the Head of State, initiated <nulltag> substantive </nulltag> cooperation with leading international partners. 
It was <nulltag> symbolic </nulltag> that the <nulltag> satellite </nulltag> launch was <nulltag> carried </nulltag> out in the year that has been declared the Year of Neutrality and Peace in Turkmenistan. 
While <nulltag> indiscriminate </nulltag> by <nulltag> design, </nulltag> the regime's <nulltag> aerial </nulltag> weapons, such as barrel bombs, are strategically deployed to maximize civilian casualties and suffering. 
<nulltag> Speakers </nulltag> <nulltag> recognized </nulltag> the UNODC Global Programme for Combating Wildlife and Forest Crime and called upon the international community to support its efforts, including those aimed at promoting international cooperation and partnerships to strengthen <nulltag> criminal </nulltag> justice systems at the regional level. 
The <nulltag> purpose </nulltag> of the debate was to <nulltag> discuss </nulltag> the overarching question of how to tackle <nulltag> social </nulltag> and economic challenges and promote sustainable development by strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice systems, norms and standards, while combating the threats that undermine them, in particular transnational organized crime, illicit trafficking and corruption. 
<nulltag> Previously, </nulltag> France <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> four reports to the Security Council which outlined six combat actions undertaken in response to an <nulltag> imminent </nulltag> and serious threat and highlighted the work of the liaison and operational support detachments for MINUSMA, as well as the support of French forces in caring for the wounded. 
<nulltag> Nonetheless, </nulltag> it is <nulltag> worth </nulltag> <nulltag> noting </nulltag> the extent of the support provided by French forces to MINUSMA in several areas: 
2. The <nulltag> Fukushima </nulltag> nuclear accident <nulltag> focussed </nulltag> attention on the paramount importance of ensuring the most <nulltag> robust </nulltag> levels of nuclear safety. 
29. On 26 <nulltag> March, </nulltag> the Defence Working Group under the New Deal structure <nulltag> held </nulltag> its <nulltag> first </nulltag> meeting since November 2014. 
24. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> <nulltag> notes </nulltag> the <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> collaborative efforts by the IAEA and its Member States, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme. 
50. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> all States that have not yet done so, to become party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or <nulltag> Radiological </nulltag> Emergency, and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> submit </nulltag> herewith a note verbale regarding the signing ceremony of the Code of Good Conduct for the media and journalists during the elections to be held in Burundi in 2015 (see annex). 
<nulltag> Referring </nulltag> to <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council resolution 1631 (2005) of 17 October 2005, in which the Council recalled its invitation to <nulltag> regional </nulltag> organizations to improve coordination with the United Nations and the Declaration on the Enhancement of Cooperation between the United Nations and Regional Arrangements or Agencies in the Maintenance of International Peace and Security, adopted by the General Assembly on 9 December 1994, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> note </nulltag> of the report of the Secretary General, 
3. <nulltag> Endorses </nulltag> the <nulltag> conclusions </nulltag> and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 and requests the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to ensure their full implementation; 
To <nulltag> address </nulltag> that challenge, the <nulltag> future </nulltag> <nulltag> Trust </nulltag> Fund strategy and results framework for 2015-2020 will include a set of common indicators that will be integrated into relevant projects to provide a standardized way of collecting data. 
47. On 16 <nulltag> March </nulltag> 2015, organizations from Puerto Rico <nulltag> made </nulltag> statements regarding the status of <nulltag> human </nulltag> rights in Puerto Rico during an audience before the seven Commissioners of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, which was held at the beginning of its 154th period of sessions. 
Although only 22 per <nulltag> cent </nulltag> of <nulltag> registered </nulltag> voters <nulltag> participated </nulltag> in that referendum, the results triggered a process whereby another referendum was to be held in 2007 to potentially amend Puerto Rico's Constitution and establish a one-house system in 2009. 
<nulltag> Cognizant </nulltag> of the fact that the risk of use of nuclear weapons, with their <nulltag> unacceptable </nulltag> consequences, can be <nulltag> avoided </nulltag> only when all nuclear weapons have been eliminated, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> risks </nulltag> increase over time. 
29G.36 The <nulltag> regular </nulltag> <nulltag> budget </nulltag> resources would be <nulltag> complemented </nulltag> by extrabudgetary resources estimated in the amount of $8,811,900, including the continuation of 30 posts, to support financial policy development and financial management reform initiatives, audit liaison and coordination, and the capacity of the Financial Resources Management Service to support extrabudgetary activities of UNODC, including financial operations for field offices and donor financial reporting.

They have <nulltag> violated </nulltag> <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council resolutions, undermined the <nulltag> political </nulltag> transition in Yemen that was based on the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism and the outcomes of the comprehensive National Dialogue conference, and have rejected dialogue to resolve the crisis. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that the additional requirements of <nulltag> $27.5 </nulltag> million under national staff costs comprised total costs of $23.0 million, attributable to the increase in the national salary rates rate, and that the remaining amount of $4.5 million had not been included in the request for additional resources because it had been used for the payment of termination indemnities to national staff separated at the Kinshasa headquarters office.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> the word <nulltag> "obligation" </nulltag> is <nulltag> used </nulltag> (rule 211.5), it shall be replaced with the word "commitment"; 
The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> had actively <nulltag> supported </nulltag> the development of cotton and glass production; <nulltag> many </nulltag> enterprises had been formalized, and red tape had been cut to foster competitiveness of local firms. 
The <nulltag> country </nulltag> had also <nulltag> focused </nulltag> on craftsmanship through the <nulltag> widespread </nulltag> funding of microprojects; the provision of key infrastructure, such as electricity in rural areas; and the creation of an international craft fair. 
<nulltag> Implementation </nulltag> is ongoing, but <nulltag> additional </nulltag> extrabudgetary resources will be <nulltag> needed </nulltag> to ensure full implementation. 
At the same <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> the Working Group <nulltag> began </nulltag> a <nulltag> preliminary </nulltag> discussion on the non-paper. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> York, 27 April-22 May 2015 
92. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the continued implementation by the Department of Public Information of the <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> Reham Al-Farra Memorial Journalists' Fellowship Programme for broadcasters and journalists from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, as mandated by the General Assembly, and requests the Department to consider how best to maximize the benefits derived from the Programme by extending, inter alia, its duration and the number of its participants; 
<nulltag> Resource </nulltag> requirements ($750,100) are proposed to be <nulltag> redeployed </nulltag> between Alteration and improvement (component A) and Major maintenance (component B) for Nairobi, to better reflect the <nulltag> operational </nulltag> needs for the biennium, with no net impact on the overall level of the proposed provision. 
36. <nulltag> Illegal </nulltag> <nulltag> sources </nulltag> of income <nulltag> include </nulltag> embezzlement, tax fraud, misuse of government benefits, robbery and theft, taking out loans from banking and nonbanking institutions (short-term loans from small credit institutions that charge higher interest rates) without intention to repay or using fraudulent documents, and opening numerous bank accounts and abusing the bank overdraft limit to withdraw cash. 
A <nulltag> focus </nulltag> on countries of origin and destination <nulltag> obscures </nulltag> the fact that countries of transit are also at <nulltag> high </nulltag> risk and face a major burden. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
10. <nulltag> Likewise, </nulltag> the <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> measures and plans of all nuclear-weapon States to <nulltag> modernize </nulltag> or upgrade their nuclear weapon arsenals, and of certain nuclear-weapon States to develop new types of such weapons, including new types of tactical nuclear weapons, which reduces the threshold for their use and increases the possibility and risk of their use, are other sources of grave concern with regard to nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
<nulltag> Such </nulltag> <nulltag> acts </nulltag> are having adverse effect on prospects for <nulltag> achieving </nulltag> the universality of the Treaty by sending a wrong message that being a non-party to the Treaty is more privileged than being a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty. 
<nulltag> Expressing </nulltag> <nulltag> concern </nulltag> at the <nulltag> increased </nulltag> use, in a globalized society, by terrorists and their supporters of new information and communication technologies, in particular the Internet, for the purposes of recruitment and incitement to commit terrorist acts, 
<nulltag> Following </nulltag> the <nulltag> usual </nulltag> <nulltag> consultations, </nulltag> I wish to inform you of my intention to appoint Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed (Mauritania) as my new Special Envoy for Yemen, at the level of Under-Secretary-General. 
In the <nulltag> fulfilment </nulltag> of his tasks, my <nulltag> Special </nulltag> Envoy will <nulltag> work </nulltag> closely with the members of the Security Council, the Gulf Cooperation Council and other partners. 
<nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> <nulltag> Representative </nulltag> of Peru to the United Nations 
<nulltag> Participatory </nulltag> monitoring for accountability <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> <nulltag> responsible </nulltag> collaboration between people and their Government, and can promote social inclusion and equality, especially for those whose voices are not heard and excluded groups. 
In <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with these <nulltag> regulations, </nulltag> the Government of Japan exercises <nulltag> careful </nulltag> control over exports of all items on the lists attached to the Orders by means of a licensing requirement. 
2. The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of Japan has <nulltag> taken, </nulltag> in accordance with the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act, <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> measures to freeze the funds, other financial assets and economic resources within Japanese territory that are owned or controlled by the individuals designated by the Committee. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Group </nulltag> further <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the efforts aimed at establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in all regions of the world and, in this regard, strongly supports the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
6. As <nulltag> reported </nulltag> previously, all declared chemicals have been removed from the <nulltag> territory </nulltag> of the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> Arab Republic, and all declared stocks of the Category 1 chemicals have been destroyed. 
The <nulltag> OPCW </nulltag> Declaration Assessment Team is currently <nulltag> undertaking </nulltag> its <nulltag> eighth </nulltag> visit to the Syrian Arab Republic in order to clarify outstanding issues and consult further with the Syrian authorities. 
With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to whether there was or should be a <nulltag> model </nulltag> scale of priority to <nulltag> determine </nulltag> whether some issues or uses should take precedence over others, or whether the scale could be adapted to suit each case or circumstance, Mr. Becker-Weinberg noted that that depended on how marine spatial planning was perceived by individual States. 
In the <nulltag> case </nulltag> of the parties to the Nauru Agreement, he <nulltag> stressed </nulltag> that only those countries that supported arrangements to shift rights to <nulltag> coastal </nulltag> States would enjoy the benefits of access to the resources of the countries that were parties to the Nauru Agreement. 
7. No <nulltag> provisions </nulltag> have been <nulltag> made </nulltag> in the proposed programme budget for the biennium <nulltag> 2016-2017 </nulltag> for the implementation of the activities requested under operative paragraphs 1 (a), (b) and (c) of the draft resolution. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Tuesday, </nulltag> 21 April 2015, at 10.15 a.m. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> In-depth </nulltag> <nulltag> knowledge </nulltag> within the United Nations system is spread widely, is often highly relevant to the Organization's work and institutional development and is often very specialized. 
22. In a <nulltag> later </nulltag> <nulltag> phase, </nulltag> if <nulltag> supported </nulltag> by key stakeholders, the Libraries board could be extended to include the libraries of the funds, programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system. 
In this <nulltag> case, </nulltag> Russia should also <nulltag> seek </nulltag> the opinion of many other <nulltag> European </nulltag> countries to which after the Second World War the Soviet Union had exported a totalitarian regime and where it had brutally suppressed any attempts at democratic change, as what happened in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and many other capitals of the so-called "socialist camp". 
Just in the same <nulltag> way </nulltag> that the Soviet Union had <nulltag> divided </nulltag> Europe into <nulltag> ideological </nulltag> camps after the Second World War, contemporary Russia tries to divide the continent into spheres of influence and to conserve dictator regimes by creating and supporting "frozen" conflicts. 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> its <nulltag> previous </nulltag> resolutions and the <nulltag> statements </nulltag> of its President relating to the situation in Côte d'Ivoire, in particular resolutions 1880 (2009), 1893 (2009), 1911 (2010), 1933 (2010), 1946 (2010), 1962 (2010), 1975 (2011), 1980 (2011), 2000 (2011), 2045 (2012), 2062 (2012), 2101 (2013), 2112 (2013), 2153 (2014), and 2162 (2014), 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to take this <nulltag> opportunity </nulltag> to express my gratitude to Major General Hafiz Masroor Ahmed for his contribution to UNOCI. 
<nulltag> Letter </nulltag> <nulltag> dated </nulltag> 3 June 2015 from the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> addressed to the President of the Security Council 
But the <nulltag> United </nulltag> States did not <nulltag> roll </nulltag> back its inveterate hostile policy towards the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> People's Republic of Korea and has missed all the opportunities. 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States has already been <nulltag> disqualified </nulltag> to talk about dialogue and the <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> issue owing to the anachronistic moves to stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
These <nulltag> "elections" </nulltag> <nulltag> constitute </nulltag> a <nulltag> clear </nulltag> violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the norms and principles of international law and, therefore, have no legal effect whatsoever. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> items 33 and 38 
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> wishes </nulltag> to reassure the Government of Rwanda that no elements of the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda are <nulltag> present </nulltag> on Burundian territory. 
15. Therefore, the 2015 <nulltag> Review </nulltag> Conference should <nulltag> agree </nulltag> on <nulltag> concrete </nulltag> steps for the speedy implementation of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East and the 2010 plan of action. 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States has long <nulltag> supported </nulltag> such a zone, although our view is that a <nulltag> comprehensive </nulltag> and durable peace in the region and full compliance by all regional states with their arms control and nonproliferation obligations are essential precursors for its establishment. 
<nulltag> Underlining </nulltag> the <nulltag> contribution </nulltag> of <nulltag> neutral </nulltag> Turkmenistan in the United Nations-led inter-Tajik talks, through the initiative to host the continual round of the interTajik talks in Ashgabat in 1995 and 1996, and in addressing conflict in Afghanistan by hosting inter-Afghan talks and an international forum on Afghanistan in 1997 and continuing to offer the territory of Turkmenistan for further inclusive, Afghan-led dialogue on reconciliation, 
<nulltag> Reaffirming </nulltag> the <nulltag> sovereign </nulltag> <nulltag> right </nulltag> of every State to determine independently its foreign policy in accordance with the norms and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 
As <nulltag> descendants </nulltag> of nations with <nulltag> different </nulltag> ethnic and religious origins who <nulltag> endured </nulltag> these sufferings amid the conditions of the First World War, we understand what the Armenians feel. 
As a <nulltag> consequence </nulltag> of our <nulltag> historical </nulltag> responsibilities and humane mission, and without <nulltag> making </nulltag> any distinction among those who suffered, we respectfully remember today all those who lost their lives in those events that transpired a century ago. 
3. <nulltag> Endorses </nulltag> the <nulltag> conclusions </nulltag> and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions2 and requests the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to ensure their full implementation; 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> it was <nulltag> recommended </nulltag> to focus on <nulltag> joint </nulltag> assessments, planning and evaluations. 
On 12 <nulltag> February </nulltag> 2015, the Group of Friends of Security Sector Reform <nulltag> held </nulltag> a <nulltag> high-level </nulltag> meeting co-chaired by Slovakia and South Africa and organized in cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the United Nations Development Programme, Co-Chairs of the inter-agency Security Sector Reform Task Force. 
These <nulltag> decisions </nulltag> would <nulltag> contribute </nulltag> to a stronger, more <nulltag> flexible </nulltag> and more responsive organization, guided by its able leadership and its whole-hearted embrace of innovation. 
24. The <nulltag> Peace </nulltag> and Security Council and the members of the Security Council <nulltag> called </nulltag> on all Malian parties to continue to engage constructively with <nulltag> sustained </nulltag> political will, a spirit of compromise and good faith towards a final settlement and stressed that the ownership and commitment of the Malian parties was crucial for the success of the whole process. 
27. The <nulltag> report </nulltag> of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing, on options for an <nulltag> effective </nulltag> sustainable development financing strategy, was <nulltag> issued </nulltag> in August 2014. 
<nulltag> Strengthening </nulltag> <nulltag> political </nulltag> <nulltag> commitment </nulltag> to sustainable forest management 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Opening </nulltag> of the session. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> rule </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received credentials signed on 27 March 2015 by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland stating that Mr. Matthew Rycroft has been appointed representative of the United Kingdom on the Security Council. 
<nulltag> Report </nulltag> of the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> the credentials of the representative of Malaysia on the Security Council 
1. <nulltag> Condemns </nulltag> all violations and abuses <nulltag> committed </nulltag> against <nulltag> journalists, </nulltag> media professionals and associated personnel in situations of armed conflict, and calls upon all parties to armed conflict to bring an end to such practices; 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> the Geneva <nulltag> Conventions </nulltag> of 12 August 1949, in particular the Third Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the treatment of prisoners of war, and the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977, in particular article 79 of the Additional Protocol I regarding the protection of journalists engaged in <nulltag> dangerous </nulltag> professional missions in areas of armed conflict, 
158. A <nulltag> modest </nulltag> <nulltag> set-up </nulltag> at OHCHR headquarters could <nulltag> address </nulltag> these questions of inadequate resources and capacity vis-à-vis growing demands, including with respect to the safety and security of OHCHR personnel in the field, while also responding to the demands made in reviews and action plans. 
319. The <nulltag> Inspector </nulltag> <nulltag> concludes </nulltag> that the Office should initiate steps to require mandate holders, <nulltag> effective </nulltag> from 2015, to make full disclosure to the Human Rights Council of all forms of support, including funding and any conditions attached to them, that they receive from sources other than the Office, in order to increase transparency and independence and to dispel misgivings. 
12. United Nations <nulltag> Television </nulltag> and United Nations Photo <nulltag> covered </nulltag> all <nulltag> formal </nulltag> open meetings of the Special Committee on decolonization and related press conferences, as well as relevant sessions of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, in addition to the adoption of the Committee's reports in the General Assembly plenary meetings.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> agenda* 
All of the <nulltag> accusations </nulltag> that the regime has <nulltag> levelled </nulltag> against Qatar, including those set out in its letter of 4 May 2015, are <nulltag> false, </nulltag> malicious, unfounded and illogical. 
The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum on Indigenous Issues <nulltag> reaffirms </nulltag> the need to ensure that the post2015 development agenda be fully aligned with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as well as <nulltag> international </nulltag> human rights obligations and commitments of States. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Matters <nulltag> brought </nulltag> to the attention of the Council 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> <nulltag> UNMIL </nulltag> <nulltag> supported </nulltag> the establishment of UNMEER, and coordinated closely with that mission's activities. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Conduct and discipline 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
This has <nulltag> included </nulltag> <nulltag> numerous </nulltag> <nulltag> meetings </nulltag> with, discussions with and travel to States of the region. 
17. <nulltag> Members </nulltag> of the Forum and representatives of Governments, <nulltag> intergovernmental </nulltag> organizations and bodies, United Nations entities, and non-governmental and indigenous organizations <nulltag> attended </nulltag> the session. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Measures </nulltag> <nulltag> provided </nulltag> for under this <nulltag> initiative </nulltag> include conditional cash transfer programmes with a focus on retaining young people of 14 to 18 years of age in school. 
The <nulltag> Plan </nulltag> <nulltag> contains </nulltag> provisions to promote <nulltag> regional </nulltag> electricity integration. 
For 2016, <nulltag> assuming </nulltag> that all <nulltag> outstanding </nulltag> approved <nulltag> applications </nulltag> are concluded in the form of contracts before the end of 2015 and that all related annual reports are submitted in 2016, the anticipated income is $940,000. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Standard </nulltag> clauses 10.5 and 10.6 apply automatically to any contract <nulltag> entered </nulltag> into as a result of an application for approval of a plan of work for exploration submitted after 25 July 2013. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 4 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> agenda* 
10. <nulltag> Recalls </nulltag> <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> 30 of the report of the Advisory Committee,16 and requests the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to incorporate flexible workplace strategies in the ongoing design of the strategic heritage plan, in accordance with the provisions of the present resolution, and to report thereon in the context of the next report on the strategic heritage plan; 
6. Also <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> 37 of the <nulltag> report </nulltag> of the Advisory Committee, emphasizes the prerogatives of the International Civil Service Commission and the role of the Office of Human Resources Management of the Department of Management of the Secretariat in determining the methodology for post adjustment multipliers and the cost-of-living-adjustment, and requests the Secretary-General to provide the Commission with the best estimates for inflation in order to improve forecast estimates for inflation-driven recosting;

Furthermore, the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> decided </nulltag> in its resolution 2190 (2014) that UNMIL should coordinate with the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in the provision of <nulltag> humanitarian </nulltag> assistance and support in response to the Ebola crisis. 
10. The lower <nulltag> requirement </nulltag> under facilities and infrastructure ($3.8 million) is mainly <nulltag> due </nulltag> to: <nulltag> (a) </nulltag> the reprioritization of funds to meet the additional costs of the Ebola outbreak; (b) lower fuel prices; and (c) the classification of freight to the "other supplies, services and equipment" class of expenditure in line with the new chart of accounts. 
8. <nulltag> Requests </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to continue to take all <nulltag> measures </nulltag> necessary to mitigate potential risks and to ensure that the construction project is monitored closely and is completed within the approved timeline and resources; 
The <nulltag> legislation </nulltag> of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on <nulltag> aeronautical </nulltag> safety meets all standards and recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization, <nulltag> providing </nulltag> safe and swift navigation of aircraft landing at or taking off from Ercan Airport as well as using the airspace of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> in 2014, around 25,000 planes used Ercan Airport for arrival and departure and 200,000 planes used the Ercan Advisory Airspace. 
As I have <nulltag> stated </nulltag> on <nulltag> numerous </nulltag> occasions, the <nulltag> region </nulltag> as a whole shares my country's concern over the British militarization of the South Atlantic, which has been denounced by various international forums because it creates an unnecessary and unjustified tension in the South Atlantic, a nuclear-weapon-free zone characterized by its commitment to peace. 
18. The <nulltag> Final </nulltag> Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference <nulltag> endorsed </nulltag> <nulltag> additional </nulltag> steps aimed at supporting the implementation of the 1995 Resolution, including that IAEA, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and other relevant international organizations be requested to prepare background documentation for the 2012 Conference regarding modalities for a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, taking into account work previously undertaken and experience gained. 
The <nulltag> facilitator </nulltag> and his team have <nulltag> participated </nulltag> in <nulltag> various </nulltag> events organized by civil society actors and have sought to actively engage with non-governmental organizations, academia and think tanks. 
<nulltag> Welcoming </nulltag> the <nulltag> discussion </nulltag> in the Council on 22 April 2015 on <nulltag> international </nulltag> cooperation in tax matters and its contribution to promoting the work of the Committee of Experts,

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the agenda and other <nulltag> organizational </nulltag> matters 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Algeria </nulltag> <nulltag> applauds </nulltag> the holding of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Forum on the relevance of ongoing experiences for the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East, held in Vienna on 21 and 22 November 2011. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 2012 <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> shall <nulltag> take </nulltag> as its terms of reference the 1995 Resolution." 
In <nulltag> particular, </nulltag> does the law <nulltag> applicable </nulltag> to the enforcement of international commercial settlement agreements <nulltag> include: </nulltag> 
2. Even if the mediation instrument <nulltag> contains </nulltag> an <nulltag> international </nulltag> commercial <nulltag> settlement </nulltag> agreement, in order for that instrument to have the effect of an enforceable ruling and of res judicata, it must result from mediation proceedings with the participation of a mediator accredited by a mediation centre registered with the Council of the Judiciary. 
26. <nulltag> Gender </nulltag> architecture and parity <nulltag> remains </nulltag> a particularly <nulltag> weak </nulltag> area across the United Nations system, with only 21 per cent of ratings falling into the "meets" or "exceeds" categories, and a very slow rate of progress of a 1 percentage point increase in entities rated as "meets" or "exceeds" requirements from 2013 to 2014. 
Accordingly, the <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> report </nulltag> aims at <nulltag> providing </nulltag> an overview of progress in implementing the Action Plan, including of entity-specific remedial action plans, lessons learned and next steps, and in mainstreaming gender equality in common programming processes of the United Nations at the country level, including through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and other planning frameworks. 
For <nulltag> example, </nulltag> in September 2014, the number of notifications <nulltag> received </nulltag> was 27, which exceeded a <nulltag> specified </nulltag> conjunction threshold value. 
<nulltag> Total </nulltag> <nulltag> number </nulltag> of interoperable international humanitarian response tools and services <nulltag> adapted </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> depth </nulltag> of <nulltag> institutional </nulltag> adaptation or change will <nulltag> depend </nulltag> on the capabilities and nature of each institution, whether it is legislative, executive, judicial or operational. 
For this <nulltag> institutional </nulltag> <nulltag> framework </nulltag> to be <nulltag> effective, </nulltag> it will need to fill the regulatory and implementation deficit that has thus far characterized governance in the area of sustainable development. 
<nulltag> Many </nulltag> current <nulltag> safety </nulltag> standards, <nulltag> based </nulltag> on decades of use of non-flammable technologies in the sectors, appear to restrict alternatives. 
<nulltag> Reaffirming </nulltag> its <nulltag> commitment </nulltag> to assist the parties to achieve a just, lasting, and mutually <nulltag> acceptable </nulltag> political solution, which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara in the context of arrangements consistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, and noting the role and responsibilities of the parties in this respect, 
6. <nulltag> Affirms </nulltag> its <nulltag> full </nulltag> support for the commitment of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy <nulltag> towards </nulltag> a solution to the question of Western Sahara in this context and calls for renewed meetings and strengthening of contacts; 
<nulltag> Due </nulltag> to the <nulltag> gravity </nulltag> of the situation of the war-stricken population and their urgent need of humanitarian assistance, the Islamic Republic of Iran has <nulltag> tried </nulltag> by all means to alleviate the suffering of the affected Yemeni people, efforts that have mostly been thwarted by the coalition forces. 
Only through <nulltag> Yemeni-led </nulltag> and Yemeni-owned national <nulltag> dialogue, </nulltag> with the participation of the representatives of all political parties and social groups, can we <nulltag> envision </nulltag> a prospect for peace and stability. 
<nulltag> Government-provided </nulltag> <nulltag> personnel </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Sri </nulltag> Lankan authorities would <nulltag> cooperate </nulltag> with and provide <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> information to the CIABOC.

17. <nulltag> Security </nulltag> personnel, <nulltag> including </nulltag> members of the <nulltag> national </nulltag> armed forces and internal security forces, who were kidnapped and taken hostage in August 2014 during an incursion of armed men belonging to the Nusra Front and ISIL, have still not been released. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Deputy </nulltag> <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> met with the Speaker of Parliament and the Prime Minister, as well as with Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, during his visit to Lebanon from 14 to 17 December 2014. 
18. In the <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> context, </nulltag> States parties must not <nulltag> get </nulltag> left behind by the dynamic that is starting to develop around the need to ban immoral weapons. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> May to November 1947, another 10,105 Crimean Tatars <nulltag> died </nulltag> of starvation in Uzbekistan (9 per cent of those deported to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic). 
<nulltag> Switzerland </nulltag> has <nulltag> played </nulltag> an <nulltag> active </nulltag> role, both in terms of institutional strengthening and in the review process of the Human Rights Council; it has, moreover, been a key driver in the establishment of the Office of the President of the Human Rights Council. 
For example, the <nulltag> Global </nulltag> Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from <nulltag> Land-based </nulltag> Activities <nulltag> includes </nulltag> multi-stakeholder partnerships in nutrients, wastewater management and marine litter which consider the economic and social issues in addition to the environmental aspects. 
115. The <nulltag> science-policy </nulltag> <nulltag> interface </nulltag> must also be <nulltag> woven </nulltag> into initiatives so as to not only enable an understanding of the possibilities afforded by oceans, but also to ensure informed decisions and the proper monitoring of the resultant actions (see paras. 129-132). 
He clearly <nulltag> tries </nulltag> to excuse the <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> attacks </nulltag> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and cruelly refers to the resulting enormous loss of human lives as a trivial matter. 
Despite the <nulltag> previous </nulltag> deceitful <nulltag> manoeuvres, </nulltag> the official <nulltag> points </nulltag> to nuclear warheads this regime has in its possession. 
<nulltag> Collective </nulltag> and concrete <nulltag> action </nulltag> is <nulltag> needed </nulltag> to hasten the end of this illegitimate, immoral and inhumane occupation and the realization of Palestinian freedom. 
<nulltag> Recently, </nulltag> 320 Palestinians were temporarily <nulltag> forced </nulltag> to leave their homes and livestock owing to these activities, which, in the past, have led to the destruction of <nulltag> Palestinian </nulltag> land and property in the area, including the burning of 3,000 dunums of crops after a fire caused by military drills on 28 April and the burning of 5,000 dunums of land on 4 May owing to heavy military fire. 
The <nulltag> effectiveness </nulltag> of the remedy is also <nulltag> limited </nulltag> in practice for the authors, given that there are seven district councils in Shinyanga alone, which are predominantly <nulltag> male </nulltag> and can exercise their discretion in deciding to amend customary law. 
This is one <nulltag> practical </nulltag> <nulltag> approach </nulltag> which <nulltag> ensures </nulltag> that States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have access to the peaceful uses of civil nuclear energy, while upholding high standards of safety, security and non-proliferation. 
26. The <nulltag> security </nulltag> and safety of our <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> weapons is <nulltag> given </nulltag> the very highest priority and is entirely consistent with our obligations under non-proliferation agreements. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> commitment </nulltag> of all Arab States to <nulltag> participate </nulltag> in the 2012 conference; and 
1. The <nulltag> issue </nulltag> of the establishment of a Middle East zone free of <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> weapons has long <nulltag> occupied </nulltag> the international community. 
<nulltag> Continuous </nulltag> <nulltag> support </nulltag> for <nulltag> promoting </nulltag> an integrated programme approach 
<nulltag> Likewise, </nulltag> <nulltag> many </nulltag> United Nations agencies have also <nulltag> played </nulltag> an active part in implementing the principle of free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples during the implementation of their programmes in various countries. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> three <nulltag> members </nulltag> of the Commission who <nulltag> voted </nulltag> against adoption requested that the recommendation be accompanied by a summary of their divergences of opinion, in accordance with rule 46 of the rules of procedure of the Commission. 
1. During the <nulltag> twentieth </nulltag> <nulltag> session </nulltag> of the International Seabed Authority in 2014, the Legal and Technical Commission of the Authority <nulltag> drew </nulltag> to the attention of the Council the fact that seven contracts (see annex I) for exploration for polymetallic nodules would expire in 2016 and 2017. 
There are <nulltag> limited </nulltag> <nulltag> measures </nulltag> to <nulltag> encourage </nulltag> cooperation among national authorities and with the private sector. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> last </nulltag> five years, no <nulltag> extradition </nulltag> requests have been received. 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> addendum </nulltag> <nulltag> lists </nulltag> the items on which the Security Council took action during the week ending 11 April 2015.

2. <nulltag> Affirms </nulltag> that Eritrea is more <nulltag> concerned </nulltag> about the restoration of security and stability in Yemen than other States <nulltag> owing </nulltag> to the historical and neighbourly ties between the two countries and their peoples. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Monday, </nulltag> 30 March 2015, at 10 a.m. 
The <nulltag> attached </nulltag> <nulltag> report* </nulltag> <nulltag> summarizes </nulltag> the conversations and meetings I held during my visit, as well as my conclusions. 
The <nulltag> Constitution </nulltag> sets <nulltag> forth </nulltag> <nulltag> individual </nulltag> and social rights and duties, fundamental guarantees and the right to culture, education, health care and social security with a view to building an equitable society without distinction as to creed, race, religion or political affiliation. 
9. Those <nulltag> international </nulltag> <nulltag> conferences </nulltag> <nulltag> demonstrated </nulltag> that the consequences of a nuclear weapon detonation, irrespective of the cause, for humanity would include death, destruction and displacement as well as profound and long-term damage to human health, the environment, climate and socioeconomic development. 
Although <nulltag> knowledge </nulltag> of the consequences and risks is not <nulltag> new </nulltag> -- and indeed was one of the key drivers for the negotiation and agreement of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- the compelling body of evidence that has been <nulltag> presented </nulltag> to the international community since the last Review Conference in 2010 has served to heighten awareness of the scale and extent of the consequences and thus the risks that will persist until nuclear weapons are eliminated. 
The <nulltag> Non-Proliferation </nulltag> Treaty review process was <nulltag> designed </nulltag> to mitigate the <nulltag> discriminatory </nulltag> nature of the Treaty that recognizes five nuclear-weapon States as possessing nuclear weapons. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> During the <nulltag> biennium </nulltag> <nulltag> 2016-2017, </nulltag> the following outputs will be delivered:

I <nulltag> urge </nulltag> the two <nulltag> parties </nulltag> to build on the existing momentum and agree to the holding of a <nulltag> second </nulltag> meeting of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee as soon as possible following the holding of the traditional leaders' dialogue, to address the implementation of their past decisions, including the concrete steps required to ensure that Abyei is maintained as a weapons-free zone. 
19. <nulltag> Following </nulltag> the <nulltag> agreement </nulltag> by the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee to hold a <nulltag> traditional </nulltag> leaders' dialogue at the end of April, the meeting was postponed to the second week of May owing to the participation of the Co-Chair for the Sudan in the general elections in his country, where he stood as a member of parliament in Western Kordofan.

The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> that in April 2014, <nulltag> certain </nulltag> politicians and civil society leaders alleged that preparations were being made for a genocide. 
3.62 The <nulltag> subprogramme </nulltag> is expected to <nulltag> achieve </nulltag> its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that the situation in the country in which <nulltag> electoral </nulltag> assistance is requested is conducive to a credible election.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of representatives to the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> decided, without a vote, to <nulltag> recommend </nulltag> to the Conference the adoption of a draft resolution (see para. 13). 
83. The <nulltag> patterns </nulltag> <nulltag> highlighted </nulltag> in this report demonstrate that <nulltag> sexual </nulltag> violence is not incidental, but integrally linked with the strategic objectives, ideology and funding of extremist groups. 
Under the <nulltag> applicable </nulltag> legal framework, <nulltag> women </nulltag> victims may be <nulltag> charged </nulltag> with adultery and exposed to further harm, which discourages them from seeking redress.

The <nulltag> Global </nulltag> Youth Council would <nulltag> meet </nulltag> on a <nulltag> regular </nulltag> basis to discuss project proposals and prepare a report to be presented to an appropriate body of the United Nations for further consideration. 
<nulltag> Social </nulltag> <nulltag> networking </nulltag> companies should develop such measures with a view to cooperating with <nulltag> national </nulltag> authorities to exercise effective monitoring for scams and other cybercrime-related practices.

The <nulltag> Ministers </nulltag> for Foreign Affairs <nulltag> stated </nulltag> that the agreements reached at the <nulltag> highest </nulltag> level created a firm foundation for further expansion of trilateral ties in the different fields of political, energy, trade and economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation. 
36. <nulltag> Morocco </nulltag> <nulltag> remains </nulltag> convinced of the effectiveness of the approach set out in article VII of the NPT aimed at creation of <nulltag> nuclear-weapon-free </nulltag> zones in all regions of the world, as a useful means to strengthen the regime of nuclear non-proliferation in order to secure the realization of nuclear disarmament and the consolidation of peace and security regionally and internationally. 
We now know incontrovertibly that <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council resolution 2118 (2013) has been <nulltag> violated </nulltag> and we know which party is to blame: the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> regime. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> is <nulltag> high </nulltag> <nulltag> time </nulltag> that the will of the Security Council was enforced. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Mr. Chandra Bhushan 
We should be <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> if you would have this <nulltag> letter </nulltag> and its annexes <nulltag> circulated </nulltag> as a document of the seventieth session of the General Assembly. 
20. It is in that <nulltag> context </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> <nulltag> believes </nulltag> that it is unnecessary to establish a senior-level working group to review, in consultation with other departments, the OHCHR strategic planning process and to report thereon to the General Assembly. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> also <nulltag> affirms </nulltag> that, through the <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> for Programme and Coordination, there is oversight of programme matters. 
<nulltag> Efforts </nulltag> to <nulltag> ban </nulltag> <nulltag> fissile </nulltag> material relate to action 15 of the action plan.

On 3 <nulltag> May </nulltag> 2015, the Republic of Armenia <nulltag> conducted </nulltag> the <nulltag> so-called </nulltag> "elections" to the "parliament" of the puppet separatist regime that it had established in the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs of Romania <nulltag> stated </nulltag> on 4 May 2015 that it "considers illegitimate the <nulltag> legal </nulltag> framework under which have been organized the so-called `parliamentary elections' on 3 May 2015 in the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh", and reiterated its "consistently asserted principled position of non-recognition of the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh region".

As long as this <nulltag> situation </nulltag> continues, there will be <nulltag> little </nulltag> fiscal space for locally <nulltag> driven </nulltag> development, or even for basic service delivery. 
<nulltag> Syria </nulltag> <nulltag> calls </nulltag> on the Security Council to condemn this act of terrorism and take tangible, <nulltag> stern </nulltag> measures against the terrorist groups and those States that support and sponsor them, in accordance with its relevant resolutions, in particular resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) and 2199 (2015). 
The Syrian <nulltag> Arab </nulltag> Republic <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> that this <nulltag> cowardly </nulltag> act of terrorism, which was aimed at innocent civilians, will not succeed in shaking the unity of the Syrian people in all its components, a trait that has characterized that people throughout its long history. 
With <nulltag> respect </nulltag> to the future of New Caledonia, the President of the Republic <nulltag> reminded </nulltag> elected officials that a referendum among the people of New Caledonia on the question of the Territory's assumption of <nulltag> full </nulltag> sovereignty would take place on a date chosen by the Congress or, if the Congress did not choose a date, by 2018 at the latest.

In 2013, young <nulltag> people </nulltag> <nulltag> aged </nulltag> <nulltag> 15-24 </nulltag> accounted for 31 per cent of new HIV infections globally, with 57 per cent of those new infections in this age group occurring among adolescent girls and young women [1]. 
While <nulltag> actual </nulltag> international <nulltag> disbursements </nulltag> <nulltag> rose </nulltag> marginally in 2013, commitments to new funding from traditional funding sources decreased by 3 per cent [18] and there remains a significant gap between the resources needed and the investment made in AIDS resources.

45. In the <nulltag> framework </nulltag> of the follow-up to the <nulltag> fourth </nulltag> World Conference on Women and to the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly <nulltag> entitled </nulltag> "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century", the regional commissions held regional reviews, in partnership and collaboration with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. 
At the same <nulltag> time </nulltag> the <nulltag> unutilized </nulltag> balances under this category will be <nulltag> transferred </nulltag> to the Special Account of Voluntary Contributions for Core Activities. 
<nulltag> Operations </nulltag> of the MCIF will be <nulltag> reviewed </nulltag> by the policymaking organs in the framework of the established programme and budgets approval process to determine, inter alia, the adequacy of the fund balance and the level of allocations required within the <nulltag> regular </nulltag> budget after considering such factors as extrabudgetary contributions received or pledged for items covered by the Fund, rate of implementation, and adjustments to the schedule of capital investments due to changes in circumstances or prioritization.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> Iraq 
22. The <nulltag> issue </nulltag> of verification lies at the heart of the disarmament and arms control process and in South Africa's view <nulltag> forms </nulltag> a <nulltag> critical </nulltag> element of that process. 
<nulltag> South </nulltag> Africa has <nulltag> worked </nulltag> on a <nulltag> continuous </nulltag> basis, both in its national capacity and in the context of the political, regional and other groupings in which it participates, to promote the CTBT in general and also to promote its entry into force through the early signature and ratification of the Treaty, especially by those States whose ratification are required for its entry into force. 
The <nulltag> massacres </nulltag> and the crimes against humanity <nulltag> committed </nulltag> by <nulltag> armed </nulltag> terrorist groups, the latest of which was the Mab`ujah massacre, makes it imperative for, indeed, incumbent on, peace-loving States to take punitive measures against those States that support and fund the indiscriminate terrorism that has been directed against Syria and its people for more than four years. 
The <nulltag> section </nulltag> also <nulltag> contains </nulltag> analyses of some of the <nulltag> economic </nulltag> challenges faced in the region, as well as a discussion of some key policy options. 
The <nulltag> expansion </nulltag> <nulltag> took </nulltag> place in nearly all those economies, but growth was driven mainly by <nulltag> mineral </nulltag> resource production in Papua New Guinea, which accounts for close to 60 per cent of the output of those economies. 
The <nulltag> regime's </nulltag> actions are now on the way to <nulltag> making </nulltag> Syria into a <nulltag> failed </nulltag> State, posing a threat to the security and stability of the region and of the world as a whole. 
<nulltag> Contributions </nulltag> to the PUI from the United States and other <nulltag> international </nulltag> donors have <nulltag> provided </nulltag> the IAEA with additional flexibility and resources to support high priority IAEA Member State projects and to respond to unforeseen challenges, sometimes on short notice. 
The <nulltag> International </nulltag> Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is an <nulltag> international </nulltag> judicial body <nulltag> established </nulltag> by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to adjudicate disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention.

20. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> of Ministers, inter alia, <nulltag> endorsed </nulltag> the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade <nulltag> 2014-2024 </nulltag> and requested the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa to mainstream the Vienna Programme of Action into the programme of work of the Commission, as appropriate and within its mandate, and to submit analytical reports on the implementation of the Programme of Action, as called for in its paragraph 75. 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations <nulltag> continues </nulltag> to prioritize and strengthen the <nulltag> timely </nulltag> recruitment and deployment of skilled and experienced humanitarian staff, while remaining committed to the need for diversity in geographical representation and gender balance. 
<nulltag> UNDP </nulltag> has <nulltag> developed </nulltag> a <nulltag> new </nulltag> contract management policy which is in the final stages of review and consultation before it is launched and implemented across the organization.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme 
For the biennium <nulltag> 2016-2017, </nulltag> these consolidated <nulltag> resources </nulltag> are <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> in the amount of $446,158,100 before recosting, reflecting a net decrease of $989,900 (0.2 per cent) compared with the appropriation for the biennium 2014-2015. 
On <nulltag> instructions </nulltag> from my Government, I <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> to you herewith the points that were agreed on at the <nulltag> second </nulltag> Moscow consultative meeting in relation to the first agenda item proposed by the meeting's facilitator, which concerns the assessment of the current situation in Syria (see annex). 
<nulltag> Miscellaneous </nulltag> <nulltag> income </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> international </nulltag> <nulltag> community </nulltag> has consistently <nulltag> deplored, </nulltag> in the strongest terms, the use of military force against Azerbaijan and the resulting occupation of its territories. 
In the <nulltag> coming </nulltag> months, the <nulltag> reports </nulltag> will produce a <nulltag> detailed </nulltag> road map to assist in the building of capacity to resist the threat of foreign terrorist fighters. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
This <nulltag> process </nulltag> has <nulltag> involved, </nulltag> among other tasks, searching for and reviewing a <nulltag> significant </nulltag> number of documents for disclosure purposes, as well as preparing two major submissions on related issues at the order of the Trial Chamber. 
It is <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> that the <nulltag> judgement </nulltag> could be rendered in the <nulltag> last </nulltag> quarter of 2015, unless unforeseen circumstances arise. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Adoption </nulltag> of the agenda and other <nulltag> organizational </nulltag> matters. 
1. The <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the forty-ninth session of the Commission on Population and Development <nulltag> set </nulltag> out below has been prepared on the basis of existing legislative authority, in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1894 (LVII). 
<nulltag> Final </nulltag> <nulltag> disposition </nulltag> of the assets of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Thursday, </nulltag> 26 March 2015, at 3 p.m. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on its 2013 and 2014 sessions 
In <nulltag> recent </nulltag> <nulltag> months, </nulltag> the Syrian Government has <nulltag> allowed </nulltag> terrorists to use its territory as a launching base to plant roadside bombs, fire rockets into Israel and open fire on Israel Defense Forces inside Israel. 
The <nulltag> challenge </nulltag> of skill was about how to <nulltag> deal </nulltag> effectively with such established goals and how to mobilize the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> resources. 
There was a <nulltag> call </nulltag> to <nulltag> strengthen </nulltag> the engagement of <nulltag> civil </nulltag> society and young people in the post-2015 development agenda. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Accepts </nulltag> the financial report and <nulltag> audited </nulltag> financial statements of the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014;1 
<nulltag> Protect </nulltag> <nulltag> activities </nulltag> of the Task Force from undue influence by vested interests 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> completion rates, especially for girls and <nulltag> young </nulltag> women, <nulltag> remain </nulltag> low on average, at 37 per cent, and highly skewed towards higher-income urban populations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> number </nulltag> of children <nulltag> enrolled </nulltag> in school has increased from 62 million in 1990 to 149 million in 2012 but resources have failed to keep up with this increase (ECA and others, 2014). 
<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> of the Assembly 
The sustainable <nulltag> management </nulltag> of all types of forests is <nulltag> vital </nulltag> to <nulltag> poverty </nulltag> eradication, economic growth and decent employment, food security and nutrition, gender equality, governance, health, water quality and supply, energy production, climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, watershed protection and disaster risk reduction. 
3. In <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with rule 3 of the rules of procedure, the Conference, on the proposal of the President, <nulltag> appointed </nulltag> the <nulltag> following </nulltag> countries as members of the Credentials Committee: Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Kyrgyzstan, Norway and Viet Nam. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> and information <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> action taken pursuant to judgments and orders of the Tribunal 
33. The <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> should <nulltag> observe </nulltag> the principles set forth in its Statute and maintain the <nulltag> balanced </nulltag> development of activities to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation and to peacefully use nuclear energy. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> are <nulltag> international </nulltag> <nulltag> standards </nulltag> for the treatment of children, and Palestinian children are no exception. 
<nulltag> Switzerland </nulltag> is of the view that such an instrument should be of a <nulltag> multilateral </nulltag> character, non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable and should <nulltag> cover </nulltag> the future production and existing stocks of fissile material. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> therefore is a State party to all <nulltag> international </nulltag> conventions in the field of nuclear safety. 
This <nulltag> overexpenditure </nulltag> was <nulltag> due </nulltag> mainly to the fact that two judges whose term <nulltag> ended </nulltag> in September 2014 continued to sit in case No. 21, in accordance with the Rules of the Tribunal from October 2014 until December 2014. 
In <nulltag> Liberia, </nulltag> on behalf of the Liberia configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission, my discussions with the Government, <nulltag> national </nulltag> stakeholders and international partners <nulltag> focused </nulltag> on how the Commission can best support the post-Ebola recovery process and the preparation for the drawdown of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). 
1. The <nulltag> Treaty </nulltag> on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was <nulltag> foreseen </nulltag> as a way to <nulltag> prevent </nulltag> proliferation, both horizontally and vertically, and bring about the total elimination of nuclear weapons while protecting the inalienable right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Adoption </nulltag> of the agenda and organization of work. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Discussion </nulltag> on the theme <nulltag> "Indigenous </nulltag> peoples: conflict, peace and resolution". 
7. This <nulltag> system </nulltag> is further <nulltag> weakened </nulltag> by doctrines of deterrence whereby the <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States have granted themselves the right to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States in certain circumstances.

<nulltag> South </nulltag> America's commodity exporters, particularly oil exporters, have <nulltag> experienced </nulltag> <nulltag> significant </nulltag> changes in the terms of trade and, consequently, in their external accounts, in addition to weaker investment prospects. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> America 
<nulltag> Brazil </nulltag> also <nulltag> supported </nulltag> the General Conference decision in 2013 to request from the secretariat a <nulltag> supplementary </nulltag> document, produced after consultation with Member States and submitted for consideration and action by the IAEA Board of Governors. 
64. <nulltag> Brazil </nulltag> has <nulltag> converted </nulltag> all of its <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> research reactors for the use of lowenriched uranium fuel. 
They <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to be incited to terrorism by <nulltag> political </nulltag> and religious <nulltag> leaders </nulltag> whose provocations know no bounds, and here I must draw attention to recent Israeli intelligence reports that extremist Jewish rabbis are inciting settlers in yeshivas to commit acts of terror and violence, including at least 20-30 settlers who are being prepared to carry out suicide attacks. 
131. <nulltag> Supportive </nulltag> <nulltag> institutions </nulltag> at all levels <nulltag> need </nulltag> to enable diverse actors to effectively align their efforts with the objectives of the post-2015 development agenda and the global partnership for sustainable development that will underpin it. 
<nulltag> Actions </nulltag> to <nulltag> achieve </nulltag> poverty eradication and <nulltag> sustainable </nulltag> development are interdependent and require integrated policy responses that maximize opportunities for synergy and balance trade-offs. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
Under these <nulltag> circumstances, </nulltag> it is <nulltag> imperative </nulltag> for the international community to <nulltag> get </nulltag> more effectively involved in ending the senseless aerial attacks and establishing a ceasefire, ensuring delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance to the people of Yemen and restoring peace and stability to this country through dialogue and national reconciliation without preconditions. 
<nulltag> Given </nulltag> the <nulltag> subjective </nulltag> <nulltag> nature </nulltag> of the logical framework, and in order to provide the most consistent categorization possible that would provide an indication of where we stand today, standard criteria were used for the categorization of each element, using the approved definitions of the corresponding results-based-budgeting elements, as reflected in table 3.

Regardless of both the improved <nulltag> control </nulltag> and management of ammunition, weapons and <nulltag> explosive </nulltag> stockpiles by the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities and international community support for the development of an improved process for <nulltag> inspecting </nulltag> ammunition stockpiles in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the risk of accidental explosion remains, because of ageing ammunition and poor storage conditions. 
33. Since its <nulltag> inauguration, </nulltag> the Presidency has <nulltag> made </nulltag> <nulltag> official </nulltag> visits to Slovenia and Croatia.

This <nulltag> failure </nulltag> to <nulltag> address </nulltag> <nulltag> human </nulltag> rights violations perpetuates the insecure environment for civilians in Darfur and contributes to widespread impunity. 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> on 14 April, <nulltag> antiriot </nulltag> police <nulltag> arrested </nulltag> 20 students, while dispersing a demonstration of approximately 200 students at El Fasher University. 
9. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> in this regard all <nulltag> national, </nulltag> regional and international efforts, including by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, that <nulltag> aimed </nulltag> at supporting the efforts of the Governments of the affected countries to stem the spread of the outbreak and addressing its impacts, including through the deployment of health workers and the provision of laboratories and medical equipment; 
48. Also <nulltag> reiterates </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> for all countries and <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> multilateral institutions to continue efforts to enhance coherence in their trade policies towards African countries, and acknowledges the importance of efforts to fully integrate African countries into the international trading system and to build their capacity to compete through such initiatives as aid for trade and, given the world economic and financial crisis, the provision of assistance to address the adjustment challenges of trade liberalization; 
<nulltag> Due </nulltag> to the technical <nulltag> nature </nulltag> of these <nulltag> recommendations, </nulltag> the proposed reassignment and redeployment of Environmental Officers in the Occupational, Health, Safety and Environment Unit reflect the first step in implementing the measures (see annex I to the present report). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Thirty-first </nulltag> <nulltag> session </nulltag>

For 2015, further <nulltag> devaluations </nulltag> of <nulltag> national </nulltag> currencies are <nulltag> projected </nulltag> for Egypt, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Yemen owing to their weak balance-of-payment situations.

As <nulltag> part </nulltag> of efforts to <nulltag> disseminate </nulltag> information to the public and renew the call for <nulltag> international </nulltag> cooperation and private participation in facilitating the tracking and arrest of the nine remaining fugitives, the fugitive-tracking team continued with the implementation of the International Fugitives Initiative, launched by the Prosecutor in Kigali on 24 July 2014, through the distribution of updated posters of the fugitives and the preparation of audio and video materials for dissemination. 
In this <nulltag> context, </nulltag> the Mechanism is particularly <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> to the Security Council and the international community for their support of relocation efforts, and <nulltag> urges </nulltag> that these be continued and expanded, with the aim of resolving this crucial humanitarian challenge. 
<nulltag> Assad's </nulltag> forces <nulltag> bear </nulltag> the <nulltag> overwhelming </nulltag> responsibility for the war crimes committed in Syria.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
4. <nulltag> This, </nulltag> the <nulltag> nineteenth </nulltag> monthly report, is therefore <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> in accordance with the aforementioned Council decisions, and includes information relevant to the period from 23 March to 22 April 2015. 
<nulltag> Dialogue </nulltag> between OPCW <nulltag> technical </nulltag> experts and the Syrian authorities <nulltag> continues </nulltag> with regard to the initial declaration by the Syrian Arab Republic and subsequent amendments. 
1. At its 2nd <nulltag> plenary </nulltag> <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> on 19 September 2014, the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the General Committee, <nulltag> decided </nulltag> to include in the agenda of its sixty-ninth session the item entitled "Human resources management" and to allocate it to the Fifth Committee. 
The <nulltag> main </nulltag> <nulltag> purpose </nulltag> of this event is to present and <nulltag> discuss </nulltag> worldwide research related to the NPT and to learn from early career scholars about present and future challenges and opportunities for the treaty. 
43. The <nulltag> Netherlands </nulltag> has consistently <nulltag> reaffirmed </nulltag> its support for the process for the establishment of a zone <nulltag> free </nulltag> of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. 
11. <nulltag> Mexico </nulltag> <nulltag> reiterated </nulltag> that the Oslo, Nayarit and Vienna discussions and conclusions must feed into a <nulltag> diplomatic </nulltag> process leading to the negotiation and conclusion of a legally binding instrument on prohibition. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> 44 of the terms of reference, the Group's functions are to have an overview of the review process in order to identify challenges and <nulltag> good </nulltag> practices and to consider technical assistance requirements in order to ensure effective implementation of the Convention. 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to its endorsement by the Conference at its <nulltag> third </nulltag> session and in accordance with the terms of reference of the Review Mechanism, the comprehensive self-assessment checklist was to be <nulltag> used </nulltag> by all States parties under review as the first step of the review process. 
The <nulltag> Agency </nulltag> should by no means seek <nulltag> new </nulltag> interpretations of existing agreements, nor seek to <nulltag> pursue </nulltag> additional measures under existing agreements that are not clearly specified therein. 
4. <nulltag> Reaffirm </nulltag> the <nulltag> crucial </nulltag> importance of <nulltag> achieving </nulltag> the universality of the comprehensive safeguards agreements as an important contribution to both the nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives of the Treaty. 
The <nulltag> Board </nulltag> was <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that efforts to upload <nulltag> special </nulltag> performance reports into this system for all other staff are under discussion with United Nations Headquarters. 
<nulltag> Noting </nulltag> with <nulltag> appreciation </nulltag> that <nulltag> voluntary </nulltag> contributions have been made to the Force, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Presentation of <nulltag> financial </nulltag> information 
In <nulltag> spite </nulltag> of such <nulltag> progress, </nulltag> however, I must <nulltag> express </nulltag> my continuing and deepest regret that allegations of the use of these weapons have not ceased, even since the time of my last letter on this subject. 
In this <nulltag> capacity </nulltag> she <nulltag> manages </nulltag> crime and drug control engagement through <nulltag> multilateral </nulltag> forums, drug control policy development and INL public affairs and public diplomacy efforts. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> item 32 
5. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> with appreciation the progress <nulltag> made </nulltag> by the Staff College in ensuring its sustainability, including through <nulltag> self-generated </nulltag> resources; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> African </nulltag> region: [to be <nulltag> completed] </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Working </nulltag> <nulltag> Group </nulltag> I held nine meetings, from 9 to 22 April 2015. 
<nulltag> Swift </nulltag> <nulltag> investigations </nulltag> must be undertaken, in accordance with international standards. 
I am <nulltag> writing </nulltag> to report to the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council that Canada is taking <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> and proportionate measures in Syria in support of the collective self-defence of Iraq, in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Thursday, </nulltag> 28 May 2015, at 3 p.m. 
The <nulltag> cumulative </nulltag> <nulltag> impact </nulltag> of these policies and practices not only <nulltag> violates </nulltag> the rights of the population, but also exacerbates their social and economic conditions. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> significant </nulltag> female educational achievements, the <nulltag> majority </nulltag> of employable Palestinian women (nearly 1.1 million) are outside the labour force. 
<nulltag> Self-standing </nulltag> subsequent <nulltag> agreements </nulltag> between the parties 
The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> urges </nulltag> the continued close cooperation of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations with Member States, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, the University for Peace, the Peace Operations Training Institute, other training partners, and with the respective peacekeeping missions in the field to provide optimal and timely direction for those conducting peacekeeping operations. 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> the Special Committee <nulltag> underlines </nulltag> the importance of <nulltag> effective </nulltag> coordination among the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Peacebuilding Support Office, the Department of Political Affairs, United Nations funds, programmes and agencies, and non-United Nations partners in the planning and implementation of peacebuilding efforts, building on their respective strengths, particularly at the early stage of United Nations engagement in post-conflict situations. 
26. For <nulltag> programme </nulltag> and project <nulltag> coordination, </nulltag> the Multisectoral Committee on International Development Commitments, a subcommittee of the Social Development Committee of the National Economic and Development Authority Board, is being utilized to monitor the country's progress and the efforts of <nulltag> various </nulltag> stakeholders to promote achievement of the Goals; and to monitor, report on, review and evaluate the compliance of the Philippines with commitments made during international conferences on human and social development. 
<nulltag> Capacities </nulltag> for data utilization <nulltag> aimed </nulltag> at identifying priorities and formulating <nulltag> effective </nulltag> programmes and projects in support of the Millennium Development Goals should also be enhanced. 
3. The Forum <nulltag> recommends </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Food </nulltag> and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in coordination with indigenous peoples, organize trainings and other <nulltag> capacity-building </nulltag> development as well as establish mechanisms for engagement such as working groups and appropriate representation of indigenous peoples in relevant instruments and bodies of FAO, and provide a progress report on those activities to the Permanent Forum at its fifteenth session. 
1. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum on Indigenous Issues <nulltag> commends </nulltag> the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) for its work on <nulltag> rural </nulltag> development addressing food production and hunger, and for the high standards set in ensuring full and effective participation of indigenous peoples through the Indigenous Peoples' Forum at IFAD and the Indigenous Peoples' Assistance Facility in line with the implementation of its policy on indigenous peoples. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Chief </nulltag> of the Trade Statistics Branch <nulltag> summarized </nulltag> the discussion. 
By <nulltag> comparison, </nulltag> the <nulltag> effects </nulltag> of government <nulltag> redistributive </nulltag> policies in developing countries are still very limited because of their Governments' limited fiscal capacity. 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> <nulltag> businesses </nulltag> <nulltag> operating </nulltag> in all other sectors must be made aware that it is in their long-term interest to align their business models with global environmental goals. 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> MINUSCA <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to provide advice to the <nulltag> national </nulltag> authorities on the establishment of a reconstituted battalion of the Central African armed forces for the provision of static protection and the development of selection criteria for its personnel in line with international humanitarian law and human rights standards and with the aim of putting in place a professional, representative and balanced army. 
<nulltag> Resolved </nulltag> to stand up against attacks on the <nulltag> cultural </nulltag> heritage of any <nulltag> country </nulltag> as attacks on the common heritage of humanity as a whole, 
1. <nulltag> Condemns </nulltag> the <nulltag> barbaric </nulltag> acts of destruction and looting of the cultural heritage of Iraq <nulltag> carried </nulltag> out by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and deplores the rising incidence of intentional attacks against and threats to the cultural heritage of countries affected by armed conflict as well as damage to cultural property resulting from indiscriminate attacks and the organized looting of and trafficking in cultural objects; 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> the possibility of <nulltag> keeping </nulltag> the Working Capital Fund replenished to its <nulltag> authorized </nulltag> level is dependent on the contributions received from Member States. 
In the <nulltag> absence </nulltag> of an authority to <nulltag> borrow </nulltag> funds from <nulltag> external </nulltag> sources, the Working Capital Fund provides a vital source of cash to meet the Organization's financial commitments when there is insufficient income from assessed contributions due to delays or non-payments by Member States. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Evaluation </nulltag> Office has commissioned a synthesis study to <nulltag> capture </nulltag> lessons learned from country programme evaluations commissioned by UNFPA between 2010 and 2013. 
<nulltag> Annual </nulltag> <nulltag> report </nulltag> on evaluation 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of this <nulltag> reflects </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> Chile accords to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> by Chile 
The <nulltag> Executive </nulltag> Director issues an <nulltag> annual </nulltag> memo to all staff <nulltag> reporting </nulltag> the disciplinary actions taken by UNICEF to address proven wrongdoings by staff. 
4. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> its <nulltag> repeated </nulltag> recommendations to the United Nations system in which it called for studies and dedicated workshops on suicide among indigenous children and young people and notes with increasing concern that the system has not adequately responded to the recommendations and that no interventions were made on the issue by any United Nations agency. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Thursday, </nulltag> 23 April 2015, at 10 a.m. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> submit </nulltag> herewith a press release regarding the <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> electoral process in Burundi (see annex). 
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> calls </nulltag> on the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community, which played a key role in the negotiations that enabled Burundians to restore peace and democracy after they were deprived of their leader in the bloody 1993 coup d'état against President Melchior Ndadaye, to continue to support the Government, which represents the popular will, and to provide it with all necessary assistance for the success of the elections to be held between May and August 2015. 
This will <nulltag> make </nulltag> it <nulltag> possible </nulltag> to document <nulltag> evidence </nulltag> of remarkable courage in circumstances that meet the criteria established under resolution 2154 (2014) and open up the possibility of considering additional worthy candidates to be honoured for exceptional courage, as exemplified by the extraordinary bravery of Captain Mbaye Diagne. 
<nulltag> Commissioning </nulltag> <nulltag> analytical </nulltag> <nulltag> papers </nulltag> and in-house research on rethinking human development 
Over <nulltag> time, </nulltag> these <nulltag> indices </nulltag> have undergone methodological changes and adjustments, <nulltag> based </nulltag> on extensive consultations with experts and on solid analytical research. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> submit </nulltag> to you a communiqué of the Emergency Summit of Heads of State of the East African Community on the situation in Burundi, held in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania, on 31 May 2015 (see annex). 
3. The <nulltag> Heads </nulltag> of State and Government <nulltag> met </nulltag> in a <nulltag> warm </nulltag> and cordial atmosphere. 
25. In <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with the <nulltag> Secretary-General's </nulltag> ongoing promotion of system-wide collaboration on ethics-related issues, <nulltag> including </nulltag> with United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and other interested entities, the United Nations Ethics Network was established on 21 June 2010. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> item 12 (f) 
The <nulltag> Forum </nulltag> will also <nulltag> propose </nulltag> the <nulltag> indicative </nulltag> map of the trans-Mediterranean transport network to be adopted at the Conference of Ministers of Transport of the Union for the Mediterranean. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> five <nulltag> headings </nulltag> are as follows: 
22. Since the 2010 <nulltag> Review </nulltag> Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, <nulltag> significant </nulltag> progress has been <nulltag> made </nulltag> by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in the implementation of its mandate to facilitate ratification processes. 
<nulltag> On-site </nulltag> <nulltag> inspections </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Consistent </nulltag> with both the <nulltag> outcome </nulltag> document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the Declaration, States, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, should <nulltag> develop </nulltag> legislation and mechanisms at the national level to ensure that laws are consistent with the Declaration. 
<nulltag> Expressing </nulltag> also <nulltag> concern </nulltag> with the <nulltag> serious </nulltag> threat that anti-personnel mines, remnants of war and improvised explosive devices pose to the civilian population, and stressing the need to refrain from the use of weapons and devices prohibited by international law, 
34. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in empowering the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics-led implementation of the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, including through the JCMB's Counter Narcotics Monitoring Mechanism; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> also <nulltag> indicates </nulltag> that these <nulltag> costs </nulltag> were previously budgeted under the support account. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> II </nulltag> Division: renaming of the Great Lakes Integrated Operational Team to the Central Africa Integrated Operational Team 
<nulltag> Toward </nulltag> that <nulltag> end, </nulltag> we welcome the removal and destruction of more than 98 per cent of Syria's declared <nulltag> chemical </nulltag> weapons stockpile which was made possible by the extraordinary effort of the international community and the UN-OPCW Joint Mission. 
This <nulltag> revised </nulltag> <nulltag> assurance </nulltag> underscores the <nulltag> important </nulltag> security benefits of adhering to and fully complying with the NPT. 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> the GNI per capita would <nulltag> remain </nulltag> far above the graduation threshold even if oil prices remained <nulltag> low. </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Tensions </nulltag> <nulltag> increased </nulltag> between SPLA and internally displaced persons at the UNMISS protection site on 10 March, after SPLA shot two displaced persons grazing cattle outside the protection site, killing one of them, and <nulltag> stole </nulltag> 25 cattle. 
4. Since the <nulltag> breakdown </nulltag> of the talks, the IGAD Chairperson has been <nulltag> consulting </nulltag> with IGAD leaders on a proposal to expand the mediation to include <nulltag> high-level </nulltag> representation from the African Union High-level Ad Hoc Committee, the United Nations, the European Union, the Troika States and China, with the hope that a strengthened mediation would be able to move the peace process forward. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Review </nulltag> Conference could: 
All the <nulltag> obligations </nulltag> under the Treaty <nulltag> represent </nulltag> an <nulltag> integral </nulltag> package of commitments, the implementation of which, along with relevant decisions adopted at Review Conferences, would collectively contribute to its effectiveness and the realization of its objectives. 
6. As with each of the other <nulltag> main </nulltag> <nulltag> pillars </nulltag> of the Treaty, the implementation of commitments in the field of nuclear disarmament had to be <nulltag> linked </nulltag> to progress in other more overarching goals, namely treaty universality, a crucial objective to which the decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty was linked. 
17. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> with satisfaction the development of collaboration between the United Nations and the International Organization of la Francophonie in <nulltag> electoral </nulltag> monitoring and assistance, and <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> the strengthening of cooperation between the two organizations in that area; 
<nulltag> Comprehensive </nulltag> <nulltag> action </nulltag> by the Security Council is <nulltag> needed </nulltag> to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians at the hands of extremists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and end the indiscriminate aerial bombardment by Assad's forces in besieged areas across Syria. 
The <nulltag> letter </nulltag> evidently <nulltag> testifies </nulltag> to Armenia's policy of denial of its responsibility for and diverting the attention of the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community from atrocious crimes it has committed against civilians in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, including the Khojaly massacre. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 20 and 21 <nulltag> January </nulltag> 2014, a retreat for the secretariats of the Convention and the Facility was <nulltag> organized </nulltag> in Glion, Switzerland. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> committee </nulltag> assignments were more <nulltag> demanding </nulltag> than others, with the work cycle rising and falling over time. 
The <nulltag> recent </nulltag> underwater <nulltag> test-fire </nulltag> by the DPRK of a ballistic missile from a strategic submarine is a legitimate measure of a sovereign State to <nulltag> bolster </nulltag> up its self-defence capability against the provocative military manoeuvres of the United States. 
This clearly <nulltag> shows </nulltag> the <nulltag> aggressive </nulltag> <nulltag> nature </nulltag> of the US-south Korea joint military exercises against the DPRK. 
1. <nulltag> Allow </nulltag> me, at the outset, to <nulltag> give </nulltag> thanks to Almighty God, who has given us this <nulltag> beautiful </nulltag> country, Burundi. 
<nulltag> Dear </nulltag> <nulltag> Burundians </nulltag> and friends of Burundi, 
<nulltag> Legal </nulltag> Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Seychelles, between June 2009 and July 2012, <nulltag> deputed </nulltag> by the Government of India under a <nulltag> technical </nulltag> cooperation programme 
<nulltag> Noting </nulltag> with <nulltag> appreciation </nulltag> the continued reporting on progress by Member States, providing the most <nulltag> comprehensive </nulltag> overview to date of the HIV and AIDS response at the country level, 
<nulltag> Responsible </nulltag> for <nulltag> managing </nulltag> administrative, <nulltag> budgetary, </nulltag> and political issues of the Embassy; 
While <nulltag> UNHCR </nulltag> has <nulltag> made </nulltag> some gains in shifting its structure and thinking to accommodate that development dimension, it is still largely operating under a <nulltag> humanitarian </nulltag> service delivery model, which fails to capitalize on opportunities to implement a sustainable solutions-oriented approach systematically. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> results 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 20 <nulltag> April </nulltag> 2015, in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, an air strike <nulltag> conducted </nulltag> by the coalition led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hit targets in the vicinity of the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, resulting in damage to the building and property of the embassy. 
1. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Mission of Brazil to the United Nations has the honour to <nulltag> present </nulltag> its <nulltag> national </nulltag> report on the actions taken to implement paragraph 9 of resolution 2204 (2015), regarding Yemen. 
19.52 The <nulltag> objective </nulltag> of the subprogramme and <nulltag> expected </nulltag> accomplishments will be achieved assuming that the <nulltag> global, </nulltag> regional and national environments remain conducive: (a) to continued collaboration on strengthening regional economic integration; (b) to promoting and supporting sustainable agriculture and food security; (c) to supporting the efforts of least developed countries to enhance their productive capacities; and (d) to determining that adequate extrabudgetary resources are mobilized to ensure the necessary outreach and depth of technical cooperation activities. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> of Experts is <nulltag> invited </nulltag> to take note of the report and to express its views on the work of the Expert Group and on the way forward for the <nulltag> global </nulltag> geospatial information management community to actively contribute to the integration of geospatial, statistical and other information. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> pictures </nulltag> <nulltag> appear </nulltag> on four screens in the room. 
The <nulltag> Jordanian </nulltag> <nulltag> regime </nulltag> should <nulltag> take </nulltag> heed of past events and experiences, and understand that threat posed by the escalation of terrorism will transcend the borders of Syria and spread to the States of region and, indeed, the entire world, starting with Jordan, which sponsors and supports terrorism and trains terrorists. 
The <nulltag> increase </nulltag> of <nulltag> $209,526,600 </nulltag> <nulltag> reflects </nulltag> the creation of 41 new posts (3 P-5, 2 P-3, 24 General Service (Principal level), 2 General Service (Other level) and 10 National Professional Officers) to ensure a minimum capacity in country offices. 
20. The <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Bureau for Arab States, through the UNDP office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, <nulltag> supported </nulltag> the International Conference of Local Authorities in Solidarity with the Palestinian people <nulltag> "Local </nulltag> Authorities at the heart of the State of Palestine", held in Ramallah from 20 to 23 November. 
While in <nulltag> Geneva, </nulltag> the delegation also <nulltag> met </nulltag> with the Director-General of the World Health Organization and the Acting Secretary-General of the <nulltag> Inter-Parliamentary </nulltag> Union; 
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> awaits </nulltag> the Board's assessment of the actions taken by the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> in respect of those recommendations in its next report on the audit of the peacekeeping operations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 1 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> refer </nulltag> to my <nulltag> letter </nulltag> to you of 5 July 2011 in which I noted that I had directed the delegation of Iraq to resume consultations with the United Nations Secretariat on the basis of paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 1958 (2010). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> McLay (New Zealand) 
66. <nulltag> UN-Habitat </nulltag> <nulltag> supported </nulltag> the <nulltag> Office </nulltag> of the Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth substantially and politically. 
It also <nulltag> worked </nulltag> closely with two <nulltag> regional </nulltag> <nulltag> development </nulltag> banks to promote the implementation of the Habitat Agenda. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Estimates before recosting. 
By <nulltag> committing </nulltag> this international <nulltag> crime, </nulltag> Russia violated <nulltag> basic </nulltag> principles of international law and European order, destroyed the existing balance of power in the region, and triggered a security crisis in Europe -- the largest one since the Second World War. 
All of the <nulltag> above, </nulltag> as well as the imperative of standardization of <nulltag> geographical </nulltag> names, require that all parties <nulltag> respect </nulltag> the correct toponym for this sea area. 
Therefore, the <nulltag> content </nulltag> of the <nulltag> aforementioned </nulltag> letter is <nulltag> deemed </nulltag> as interference in Iran's domestic affairs and is categorically rejected. 
The <nulltag> Global </nulltag> Partnership was <nulltag> extended </nulltag> at the 2011 <nulltag> G-8 </nulltag> Summit in Deauville, France. 
<nulltag> Article </nulltag> III.2 <nulltag> requires </nulltag> that any transfer to a <nulltag> non-nuclear </nulltag> weapon State of nuclear materials and equipment especially designed or prepared for the processing, use, or production of special fissionable material be subject to IAEA safeguards. 
After <nulltag> signing </nulltag> the so-called "treaty on alliance and <nulltag> strategic </nulltag> <nulltag> partnership" </nulltag> with its occupation regime in Sokhumi, the Russian Federation signed the so-called "treaty on alliance and integration" with its occupation regime in Tskhinvali on 18 March 2015.

When <nulltag> reviewing </nulltag> <nulltag> audit </nulltag> recommendations, the relevance of risks, particularly in areas of <nulltag> high </nulltag> risk to other parts of the organization is considered. 
As a <nulltag> compensating </nulltag> control and in order to ensure transparency and <nulltag> best </nulltag> value for money, the Committee <nulltag> reiterates </nulltag> the importance of having an independent organizational focal point in UN-Women to oversee internal audit activities and ensure that results are integrated into the senior management structure. 
9. At 0940 <nulltag> hours </nulltag> on 25 Rajab A.H. 1436 (14 May A.D. 2015), two mortars <nulltag> belonging </nulltag> to the Houthi terrorist group were observed near the Hasanah observation post, <nulltag> opposite </nulltag> border markers 266 and 277, some 700 metres from the border. (Najran sector 2)

6.4 The <nulltag> UN-SPIDER </nulltag> programme was <nulltag> established </nulltag> to provide <nulltag> universal </nulltag> access to all types of space-based information and services relevant to disaster management to support the full disaster management cycle. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> submit </nulltag> to you herewith a press release by the Government of the Republic of Burundi concerning the <nulltag> current </nulltag> security and political situation in Burundi (see annex). 
10. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> the cooperation and assistance provided thus far to the <nulltag> International </nulltag> Criminal Court by States parties as well as States not parties, the United Nations and other <nulltag> international </nulltag> and regional organizations, and calls upon those States that are under an obligation to cooperate to provide such cooperation and assistance in the future, in particular with regard to arrest and surrender, the provision of evidence, the protection and relocation of victims and witnesses and the enforcement of sentences; 
<nulltag> Emphasizing </nulltag> that <nulltag> justice, </nulltag> especially <nulltag> transitional </nulltag> justice in conflict and post conflict societies, is a fundamental building block of sustainable peace,

9. <nulltag> Emphasizes </nulltag> that contingency provisions <nulltag> approved </nulltag> for construction projects serve to provide <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> safeguards against unforeseen cost overruns during project implementation, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to ensure that in the future any cost overruns are first met from compensatory reductions identified elsewhere through efficiencies in order to obviate to the extent possible the need for drawdown from contingency provisions; 
<nulltag> Convinced </nulltag> of the need for the United Nations to <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to improve its capabilities in the field of peacekeeping and to enhance the <nulltag> effective </nulltag> and efficient deployment of its peacekeeping operations, 
The <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> the importance of funding the humanitarian and development responses to the refugee crisis, providing support for <nulltag> national </nulltag> response plans, addressing the humanitarian needs of refugees, in particular women and children, both in camps and urban areas and through capacity building and technical support, strengthening the resilience of host countries and communities as components of stabilizing the region, preventing radicalization and countering the threat of terrorism and foreign terrorist fighters.

The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> further <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> its <nulltag> general </nulltag> recommendation No. 19, which has clearly placed violence against women within the ambit of discrimination against women by stating that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination against women and includes acts that inflict physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty. 
She is therefore of the <nulltag> view </nulltag> that the Danish Immigration Service has <nulltag> admitted </nulltag> that the events are <nulltag> factual, </nulltag> even though the State party considers them irrelevant and not sufficient to justify granting asylum. 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> the resolution <nulltag> calls </nulltag> upon the <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States to support the process of nuclear disarmament and to work expeditiously for the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals. 
Among other <nulltag> significant </nulltag> <nulltag> achievements </nulltag> of that process was the adoption in 2000 of the 13 practical steps <nulltag> leading </nulltag> to nuclear disarmament and of the action plan of the 2010 Review Conference, which reaffirmed and deepened those commitments. 
The <nulltag> fundamental </nulltag> <nulltag> demands </nulltag> of the Georgian side were <nulltag> rejected </nulltag> by some participants and, as a result, they walked out at the end of the round.

It is a <nulltag> situation </nulltag> <nulltag> constituting </nulltag> a <nulltag> direct </nulltag> threat to the lives of the nearly 18,000 Palestine refugees who remain in the camp, of the original 160,000 residents. 
<nulltag> Simultaneously, </nulltag> all efforts must be <nulltag> made </nulltag> to secure immediate, sustained and <nulltag> unimpeded </nulltag> humanitarian access and assistance to the camp's residents, as well as to ensure the safe exit of any civilians who seek refuge from the violence in Yarmouk.

In that <nulltag> context, </nulltag> we <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to reaffirm the point made in our <nulltag> previous </nulltag> letter, namely that the 1921 Ankara Agreement limits Turkey's property rights to the tomb and its premises, and makes no reference to Turkey's sovereignty over the site or ownership of any land.

I should be <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> for your <nulltag> cooperation </nulltag> in <nulltag> circulating </nulltag> the present letter and its annex to all the distinguished members of the Security Council and as a document of the Council. 
In <nulltag> full </nulltag> <nulltag> disregard </nulltag> of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and tantamount to a call for <nulltag> redrawing </nulltag> international borders, the statement runs counter to the spirit of cooperation, mutual understanding and good-neighbourliness and the common future of the countries of the region and their efforts to join the European Union. 
The <nulltag> statement </nulltag> is <nulltag> provocative </nulltag> and exceedingly disruptive for relations in the region, in particular between Serbia and Albania, and <nulltag> represents </nulltag> a serious threat to regional peace and stability.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the Secretary-General on the practice of the Secretary-General in <nulltag> disciplinary </nulltag> matters and cases of possible criminal behaviour, 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 
22. <nulltag> Encourages </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to continue to strengthen and improve the <nulltag> accountability </nulltag> framework by taking advantage of the benefits related to the deployment of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards and the Umoja enterprise resource planning system, and requests him to report thereon in the context of the next progress report on accountability; 
<nulltag> Al-Qaida </nulltag> in the <nulltag> Arabian </nulltag> Peninsula, the activity and influence of which has <nulltag> increased </nulltag> recently, has benefited the most from the dangerous deterioration in the political and security situations. 
<nulltag> Overall, </nulltag> UNDP management <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> some of the <nulltag> evaluation's </nulltag> findings as encouraging and useful. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the report of the Committee for Development Policy on its <nulltag> seventeenth </nulltag> session; 
<nulltag> Considering </nulltag> the <nulltag> role </nulltag> that the Disarmament Commission has been called upon to play and the contribution that it should make in examining and submitting recommendations on <nulltag> various </nulltag> problems in the field of disarmament and in promoting the implementation of the relevant decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> on the overview of human resources management reform: performance management 
<nulltag> UNICEF </nulltag> <nulltag> takes </nulltag> note of the recommendation and looks forward to the findings of the <nulltag> system-wide </nulltag> study. 
<nulltag> Summary </nulltag> 
<nulltag> States </nulltag> should <nulltag> consider, </nulltag> where <nulltag> possible </nulltag> under their national legislation, the relevant cultural property as registered in the official inventory of a State that has enacted laws on national or State ownership, provided that the owner State has issued a public formal statement to that effect. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> on Population and Development 
Both <nulltag> social </nulltag> <nulltag> media </nulltag> and traditional means of communication were integral to <nulltag> ensuring </nulltag> that all members of the global family could hear about and be part of the work of the United Nations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Paraguay </nulltag> <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> an application to become a member of the Committee and was welcomed by the Chair as an observer for 2015. 
The <nulltag> shipments </nulltag> <nulltag> included </nulltag> food assistance for almost 1.9 million people; <nulltag> non-food </nulltag> items for around 1.2 million people; water and sanitation supplies for over 430,000 people; and medical supplies and treatments for over 930,000 people. 
<nulltag> Noting </nulltag> the <nulltag> widespread </nulltag> <nulltag> interest </nulltag> in contributing to the work of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations expressed by Member States, in particular troop- and police-contributing countries, 
<nulltag> Contingent-owned </nulltag> <nulltag> Equipment </nulltag> Assistant (redeployment from the Property Management Section) 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Safety Officer 
2. <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the summary of the <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> changes to the national reporting format, and adopts the <nulltag> revised </nulltag> format for national reporting as submitted by the small intersessional working group on national reporting for use by parties to report for the year 2016 and onwards; 
The <nulltag> visit </nulltag> of the Service mission <nulltag> took </nulltag> place in April 2013, and the <nulltag> final </nulltag> report is available on the websites of the Polish National Atomic Energy Agency and IAEA. 
<nulltag> Future </nulltag> nuclear <nulltag> disarmament </nulltag> agreements will <nulltag> require </nulltag> high-level expertise, which is necessary to fulfil all the commitments related to total dismantlement of nuclear weapons. 
The <nulltag> name </nulltag> of the candidate thus <nulltag> nominated </nulltag> is set out in the annex to the <nulltag> present </nulltag> note. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of candidates <nulltag> nominated </nulltag> by States parties 
48. <nulltag> Participants </nulltag> <nulltag> noted </nulltag> a suggestion that <nulltag> new </nulltag> customary international law could come about as a result of changes in state practice regarding nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence policies. 
It was then <nulltag> suggested </nulltag> that a <nulltag> condition </nulltag> could be created to provide incentives for <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> states to adhere to such a time frame. 
There is no <nulltag> reason </nulltag> that one more <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> should be <nulltag> gassed </nulltag> to death by a brutal dictator intent on exploiting his monopoly of air power to barrel bomb his own people into submission. 
Should the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> fail </nulltag> to reach the consensus needed to authorize a <nulltag> safe </nulltag> zone, then I urge Member States to act on their own legal and moral authority to save lives in Syria and take the steps necessary to provide protection to our people. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Final disposition of assets 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> I would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to underscore the <nulltag> full </nulltag> support of the State of Qatar for the imperative content of the aforementioned draft resolution, which emphasized the need to urgently help survivors through immediate and needs-based relief assistance, underlining the crucial importance of reaching affected people and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. 
<nulltag> Based </nulltag> on the <nulltag> goals </nulltag> and purpose of the satellite, its payload included the <nulltag> latest </nulltag> equipment for multiservice communications, including digital television, telephony, videoconferencing, data transmission, satellite Internet, and very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) networks. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> and communications technologies for development 
I should be <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> if you would have this <nulltag> letter </nulltag> and its annex <nulltag> circulated </nulltag> as a document of the Security Council. 
38. The <nulltag> Declaration </nulltag> <nulltag> asks </nulltag> Contracting Parties to report on how they implement the safety objective in the siting, commissioning and operation of <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> power plants. 
<nulltag> UNSOM </nulltag> also <nulltag> facilitated </nulltag> <nulltag> mandatory </nulltag> predeployment training on human rights, child protection and gender, for 80 Ugandan soldiers in Kampala. 
At the same <nulltag> time, </nulltag> the crisis in Yemen has the <nulltag> potential </nulltag> to further <nulltag> destabilize </nulltag> the region and open a corridor for jihadist movements through Somalia. 
<nulltag> Foreign </nulltag> <nulltag> interfering </nulltag> powers and <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> groups should not be allowed to have any say in the future of Yemen. 
22. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> <nulltag> acknowledges </nulltag> the <nulltag> central </nulltag> role of the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP), to enhance the application of nuclear science and technology in many States parties, in particular, in those that are developing countries, and recognizes the Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF) as the most important mechanism for the implementation of the IAEA TCP. 
<nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> fuel </nulltag> suppliers are <nulltag> encouraged </nulltag> to work with and assist recipient States, upon request, in the safe and secure management of spent fuel. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> verbale 
The <nulltag> Council </nulltag> shall <nulltag> promote </nulltag> the <nulltag> effective </nulltag> implementation of, and compliance with, this Treaty. 
8. <nulltag> Verification </nulltag> activities shall be <nulltag> based </nulltag> on <nulltag> objective </nulltag> information, limited to the subject of this Treaty and carried out in full respect of the sovereignty of the States parties and in the least intrusive manner possible compatible with achieving their aims with the desired efficiency and time-frame. 
2. <nulltag> Expresses </nulltag> its <nulltag> appreciation </nulltag> to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States to make every <nulltag> possible </nulltag> effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Mission in full as early as possible; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> assessment </nulltag> <nulltag> rated </nulltag> 43.0 per cent of evaluation reports "very good", 28.5 per cent "good" and 28.5 per cent "satisfactory" (see figure 4). 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> addendum </nulltag> <nulltag> lists </nulltag> the items on which the Security Council took action during the week ending 9 May 2015. 
<nulltag> International </nulltag> <nulltag> environmental </nulltag> law <nulltag> remains </nulltag> applicable in armed conflict and can pertain to nuclear weapons, although it does not specifically regulate these arms. 
<nulltag> Organizational </nulltag> <nulltag> structure </nulltag> and post distribution for the biennium 2016-2017 
<nulltag> Letter </nulltag> <nulltag> dated </nulltag> 2 April 2015 from the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> addressed to the President of the Security Council 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Khaled Fattah, <nulltag> regional </nulltag> (Netherlands) 
<nulltag> Contingent-owned </nulltag> <nulltag> Equipment </nulltag> Officer 
The <nulltag> International </nulltag> Public Sector Accounting Standards <nulltag> financial </nulltag> statement shall <nulltag> provide </nulltag> a more accurate description of miscellaneous income; 
The <nulltag> production </nulltag> structure <nulltag> needed </nulltag> to be further diversified, the country was still lacking <nulltag> human </nulltag> capital and the linkages between enterprises and the educational system required strengthening. 
<nulltag> Further </nulltag> <nulltag> enhancement </nulltag> of its activities is dependent on the receipt of extrabudgetary resources. 
4. At its 2nd <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> also on 13 April, the Working Group <nulltag> began </nulltag> a <nulltag> second </nulltag> reading of the conference room paper and held an exchange of views on the "Principles" section of the document. 
63. <nulltag> Requests </nulltag> the Department of <nulltag> Public </nulltag> Information to continue to build partnerships with <nulltag> local, </nulltag> national and regional broadcasters to extend the United Nations message to all corners of the world in an accurate and impartial way, and requests the News and Media Division of the Department to continue to take full advantage of the technological infrastructure made available in recent years; 
The <nulltag> indicative </nulltag> <nulltag> timeline </nulltag> is being re-examined to <nulltag> determine </nulltag> whether the project duration can be compressed. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> As <nulltag> regards </nulltag> alteration and <nulltag> improvement, </nulltag> a provision of $3,752,400 would cover the following: 
The <nulltag> Arabs </nulltag> <nulltag> fought </nulltag> together, but Uzbek, European and Chinese militants <nulltag> tended </nulltag> to operate in ethnic silos, mutual ties to Al-Qaida notwithstanding. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Context 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
1. <nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> weapons, </nulltag> as the most horrendous, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever developed, are unique in their destructive power, in the unspeakable human <nulltag> suffering </nulltag> they cause, in the impossibility of controlling their effects in time and space and in the threat they pose to the environment, to future generations and indeed to the very survival of humanity. 
9. <nulltag> Calls </nulltag> upon Member States to help build the capacity of other Member States where <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> and appropriate and upon request, to <nulltag> address </nulltag> the threat posed by ISIL, groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIL, Ansar Al Charia, and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida operating in Libya, and welcomes and encourages bilateral assistance by Member States to help build such national, subregional or regional capacity; 
He will <nulltag> build </nulltag> on the <nulltag> achievements </nulltag> of Jamal Benomar (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), as well as the <nulltag> regional </nulltag> and international efforts of the United Nations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Wednesday, </nulltag> 25 March 2015, at 10 a.m. 
As a <nulltag> follow-up </nulltag> to that <nulltag> recommendation, </nulltag> a <nulltag> second </nulltag> phase of global consultations was launched by the United Nations in 2014 to determine how the "means of implementation" should feature in the new global framework. 
There is <nulltag> growing </nulltag> <nulltag> demand </nulltag> from Member States for <nulltag> pragmatic </nulltag> proposals on how to make the post-2015 development agenda work. 
4. The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of Japan has already <nulltag> initiated, </nulltag> in accordance with the Law for the Establishment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> measures to exercise vigilance regarding the entry into or transit through its territories of the individuals designated by the Committee, with the exceptions stipulated in paragraph 16 of resolution 2140 (2014). 
20. The <nulltag> Group </nulltag> of Non-Aligned States Parties to the Treaty also <nulltag> emphasizes, </nulltag> as it did in the First, Second and Third Sessions of the Preparatory Committee, the importance of the <nulltag> mandated </nulltag> responsibility of the United Nations Secretary-General in accordance with paragraph 7 of the 2010 action plan on the implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East. 
4. The <nulltag> Co-Chairs, </nulltag> <nulltag> Gustavo </nulltag> Meza-Cuadra (Peru) and Don MacKay (New Zealand), <nulltag> appointed </nulltag> by the President of the General Assembly, opened the meeting. 
106. Some <nulltag> representatives </nulltag> <nulltag> asked </nulltag> how indicators could be developed to address capacity development and knowledge and technology transfer for <nulltag> marine </nulltag> science, and how to make them both meaningful and measureable so as not to overburden developing countries. 
7. <nulltag> Learning </nulltag> and training are <nulltag> central </nulltag> means for <nulltag> equipping </nulltag> representatives of Member States and United Nations staff members with the knowledge they need to help to address the cross-cutting and complex challenges of today's world. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> initiative </nulltag> will <nulltag> take </nulltag> some time to implement and will require the support of Member States and the researchers themselves, with regard to both the aim and the approach. 
By its <nulltag> inadequate </nulltag> and <nulltag> propagandist </nulltag> interpretation of the Prime Minister's statements, Russia, as a self-proclaimed successor of the USSR and, unfortunately, also a successor of its imperialist traditions, <nulltag> proves </nulltag> only one fact: that for contemporary Russia, Soviet military and ideological occupation of Central and Eastern Europe, including East Germany, was just as normal as today's Russian occupation of Crimea and the Donbas. 
And no <nulltag> one </nulltag> else except <nulltag> Russian </nulltag> journalists and diplomats <nulltag> attempted </nulltag> to find a different context in his words -- a context that was not there and could never have been there. 
<nulltag> Re-emphasizing </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire to be <nulltag> able </nulltag> to respond proportionately to threats to the security of all citizens in Côte d'Ivoire and calling on the Government of Côte d'Ivoire to ensure that its security forces remain committed to upholding human rights and applicable international law, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Urges </nulltag> further in this context that all <nulltag> Ivorian </nulltag> parties and all States, particularly those in the region, ensure: 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> a spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea <nulltag> released </nulltag> a statement on 20 May 2015 clarifying the <nulltag> principled </nulltag> stand of the service personnel and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
It is the <nulltag> stand </nulltag> of the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> People's Republic of Korea not to <nulltag> allow </nulltag> the United States and its allies to brand the former's above-mentioned test-fire as a "provocation" and "threat" to regional peace, pursuant to the "resolution" of the Security Council. 
<nulltag> Participants </nulltag> <nulltag> included </nulltag> LRA <nulltag> focal </nulltag> points from United Nations entities, bilateral government partners, nongovernmental organizations, representatives of civil society from LRA-affected areas and, for the first time, ECCAS. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> submit </nulltag> to you herewith a press release by the Government of Burundi on the alleged presence of the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda in Burundi (see annex). 
<nulltag> Opposition </nulltag> <nulltag> political </nulltag> elements and civil society activists have <nulltag> cited </nulltag> the presence of the Forces and of the Interahamwe on Burundian soil with the aim of clouding the good relations of friendship and cooperation existing between these two fraternal countries. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of such a <nulltag> conference </nulltag> shall not be held hostage to preconditions. 
<nulltag> Welcoming </nulltag> the <nulltag> initiatives </nulltag> of <nulltag> neutral </nulltag> Turkmenistan directed at further strengthening economic, social, cultural and environmental cooperation in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea region, 
In the <nulltag> last </nulltag> <nulltag> years </nulltag> of the Ottoman Empire, all of us, Turks, Armenians and many others, <nulltag> suffered </nulltag> immensely. 
The <nulltag> inter-agency </nulltag> Security Sector Reform <nulltag> Task </nulltag> Force has an important role to <nulltag> play </nulltag> in developing such an evidence-based approach to Security Sector Reform support. 
<nulltag> Drawing </nulltag> on the <nulltag> remarks </nulltag> of keynote speakers and messages delivered during the <nulltag> discussion, </nulltag> four areas emerged as priorities for the implementation of Security Council resolution 2151 (2014): 
The <nulltag> net </nulltag> <nulltag> increase </nulltag> of $2,281,500, primarily under contractual services and furniture and equipment, <nulltag> reflects </nulltag> the proposed inward redeployment of centralized operational resources for the Office of Human Resources Management that were reflected under the Human Resources Information Systems Section (component 5) for the biennium 2014-2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> During the <nulltag> biennium </nulltag> <nulltag> 2016-2017, </nulltag> the following final outputs will be delivered: 
A <nulltag> costed </nulltag> <nulltag> evaluation </nulltag> plan for each country programme had been <nulltag> posted </nulltag> on the Executive Board website, as had the United Nations Development Assistance Framework results matrices. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> brother King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa, King of Bahrain; 
9. The <nulltag> Peace </nulltag> and Security Council and the members of the Security Council <nulltag> commended </nulltag> the contribution of MONUSCO, including its Force Intervention Brigade, in furthering peace and stability in the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> Republic of the Congo and welcomed the commitment of troop-contributing countries to MONUSCO in the fulfilment of its mandate for the protection of civilians. 
The <nulltag> session </nulltag> will <nulltag> provide </nulltag> a <nulltag> unique </nulltag> opportunity for Member States to convey their vision of how to integrate the full spectrum of forests' contributions within the broader development agenda, as well as demonstrate their solid commitment to a strong arrangement beyond 2015. 
<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Reaffirming </nulltag> that <nulltag> parties </nulltag> to an armed conflict bear the <nulltag> primary </nulltag> responsibility to take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of affected civilians, including those who exercise their right to freedom of expression by seeking, receiving and disseminating information by different means, online as well as offline, in accordance with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
<nulltag> Following </nulltag> an <nulltag> OIOS </nulltag> audit, a policy on <nulltag> human </nulltag> rights methodology and training and a policy on OHCHR publications were adopted by the SMT and disseminated to staff in 2013. 
<nulltag> Interviewees </nulltag> <nulltag> indicated </nulltag> that bringing together all information gathered in context of the <nulltag> universal </nulltag> periodic review, special procedures, the Human Rights Council, the treaty body system and work done by the Research and Right to Development Division remains a challenge. 
5. In <nulltag> coordination </nulltag> with the Decolonization Unit, the Department of Public Information <nulltag> arranged </nulltag> for the deployment of a <nulltag> press </nulltag> officer from the United Nations Information Centre in Canberra to cover the seminar. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> of Experts is <nulltag> invited </nulltag> to take note of the report and to express its views on the operation and achievements of the <nulltag> regional </nulltag> committees and thematic groups. 
With <nulltag> high </nulltag> <nulltag> unemployment </nulltag> and <nulltag> depleted </nulltag> savings, vulnerable households in Liberia are hard-pressed to pay the costs for reopened schools. 
The <nulltag> Deputy </nulltag> Speaker has yet to <nulltag> appear </nulltag> before the Commission and the matter remains <nulltag> pending. </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> note </nulltag> <nulltag> contains </nulltag> information on the extensions of the country programmes for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Mozambique, United Republic of Tanzania, and Yemen. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Body 2 of Main Committee II <nulltag> held </nulltag> five meetings between 7 and 18 May. 
1. The <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> has <nulltag> received </nulltag> notification by a letter dated 19 May 2015 from the Permanent Representative of Georgia that, according to the agreement among the members of the Group of Eastern European States to rotate their membership in the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law among <nulltag> themselves, </nulltag> Georgia is relinquishing its seat in favour of the Czech Republic. 
He also <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> <nulltag> several </nulltag> <nulltag> times </nulltag> specific dates and alternative venues and meeting formats, all with a view to encouraging all states to participate in a further round of consultations to try and narrow differences on arrangements. 
3. It is the <nulltag> understanding </nulltag> of the secretariat of the Permanent Forum that those <nulltag> proposals, </nulltag> objectives, recommendations and areas of possible future action to be <nulltag> carried </nulltag> out by the United Nations, as set out below, will be implemented to the extent that resources from the regular budget and extrabudgetary resources are available. 
<nulltag> Improving </nulltag> operating <nulltag> conditions </nulltag> in the <nulltag> productive </nulltag> sector and reaching those in the most vulnerable socioeconomic situations will be fundamental to the creation of quality jobs. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> between the United Nations and the International Organization of la Francophonie 
<nulltag> Please </nulltag> indicate whether the <nulltag> implementation </nulltag> of a <nulltag> gender-sensitive </nulltag> sanitation policy in schools has been considered and whether other steps have been taken to ensure adequate sanitary facilities in schools, especially for girls. 
1. <nulltag> Please </nulltag> <nulltag> provide </nulltag> information on measures taken to adopt anti-discrimination standards, in both <nulltag> legislative </nulltag> and policy frameworks, which define and protect against direct and indirect discrimination against women. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Affirms </nulltag> that the costs of the <nulltag> remaining </nulltag> activities will be met from the resources of the capital master plan project; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the Staff Counsellor 
The <nulltag> overall </nulltag> lower costs of international <nulltag> staff </nulltag> were partly <nulltag> offset </nulltag> by increased costs for danger pay entitlements, as explained in paragraph 7 above. 
4. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> made by the Mechanism to seek cooperation with other judicial institutions; 
<nulltag> Faced </nulltag> with the <nulltag> obligation </nulltag> that is equally binding on both sides to find a solution to the dispute, the United Kingdom has confirmed with this announcement that it is determined to engage in an <nulltag> arms </nulltag> build-up and warmongering. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> to Support Children <nulltag> Suffering </nulltag> from Cancer (special, 2001) 
1. <nulltag> Algeria </nulltag> considers that the creation of nuclear <nulltag> weapon-free </nulltag> zones (NWFZs), pursuant to Article VIII of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons <nulltag> (the </nulltag> NPT), effectively contributes to the consolidation of regional and international peace and security, and to the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime and achievement of the goals of nuclear disarmament. 
7. <nulltag> Algeria </nulltag> also <nulltag> notes </nulltag> that the <nulltag> final </nulltag> document of the Eighth Treaty Review Conference reaffirmed the continuing importance and validity of that resolution until its aims and objectives are attained. 
In <nulltag> order </nulltag> for an <nulltag> international </nulltag> commercial settlement agreement to be <nulltag> considered </nulltag> valid, it must fulfil the same validity requirements as those that apply to contracts (capacity, consent free of defect, lawful purpose, legitimate cause and the formalities required). 
They also <nulltag> registered </nulltag> the <nulltag> largest </nulltag> <nulltag> gain </nulltag> (10 percentage points) in meeting and exceeding requirements ratings since 2013. 
77. <nulltag> Resource </nulltag> mobilization <nulltag> remains </nulltag> a <nulltag> significant </nulltag> challenge. 
Although there are <nulltag> binding </nulltag> and <nulltag> non-binding </nulltag> <nulltag> regulations, </nulltag> the fact of the matter is that there are no sanctions in the case of a disaster caused by a space object carrying a nuclear load, other than what we might understand by "reparation in respect of the damage", in the words of the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. 
In the <nulltag> section </nulltag> below, <nulltag> major </nulltag> advances are <nulltag> presented </nulltag> in the following space debris-related activities conducted by JAXA during 2014: 
The <nulltag> Office </nulltag> for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs <nulltag> plans </nulltag> to develop a training package for staff involved in fund management and other stakeholders in line with the development and roll-out of the <nulltag> global </nulltag> guidelines for country-based pooled funds. 
<nulltag> Such </nulltag> an <nulltag> approach </nulltag> will <nulltag> need </nulltag> an institutional framework and structures that will enable it. 
62. <nulltag> Institutions </nulltag> at all <nulltag> levels, </nulltag> <nulltag> including </nulltag> Governments, the United Nations and civil society organizations, will need to learn how to remain effective and relevant in this context. 
In this <nulltag> context, </nulltag> one of the most <nulltag> significant </nulltag> contributions of the workshop has been the development of fact <nulltag> sheets, </nulltag> undertaken by the Ozone Secretariat according to a rigorous peer review process, distributed among participants in the workshop even before its opening. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> is <nulltag> widespread </nulltag> <nulltag> use </nulltag> of hydrocarbons in self-contained refrigeration cabinets and smaller commercial refrigeration equipment. 
8. <nulltag> Invites </nulltag> <nulltag> Member </nulltag> States to lend <nulltag> appropriate </nulltag> assistance to these talks; 
<nulltag> Reaffirming </nulltag> its <nulltag> strong </nulltag> <nulltag> support </nulltag> for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy to implement resolutions 1754 (2007), 1783 (2007), 1813 (2008), 1871 (2009), 1920 (2010), 1979 (2011), 2044 (2012), 2099 (2013), and 2152 (2014), 
The <nulltag> Islamic </nulltag> Republic of Iran has <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> a <nulltag> four-point </nulltag> plan to promote efforts towards ending the ongoing bloodshed and finding a political solution to the crisis.

In <nulltag> turn, </nulltag> this awareness <nulltag> underscores </nulltag> the urgency with which States parties must implement the obligations and commitments made in the Treaty and through its review process for the achievement of a world without <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> weapons.

As the <nulltag> French </nulltag> <nulltag> Co-Chair </nulltag> of the OSCE Minsk Group, Pierre Andrieu, <nulltag> noted </nulltag> on 29 April 2015, "nobody recognizes this so-called `Nagorno-Karabakh Republic'", "and for us, these elections, certainly, will be illegitimate". 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> the <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> <nulltag> joint </nulltag> United Nations and African Union review, requested in resolution 2182 (2014), into the temporary surge for AMISOM authorised in resolution 2124 (2013), and further recalling its request for the United Nations and African Union to set out recommendations for the next steps in the military campaign in Somalia, taking into due consideration the political situation, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council, 
<nulltag> Cuba </nulltag> <nulltag> reiterates </nulltag> the need for all United Nations Member States to join efforts to ensure that the remaining <nulltag> Non-Self-Governing </nulltag> Territories are able to exercise their genuine right to self-determination, including independence, as soon as possible. 
<nulltag> Cuba </nulltag> has <nulltag> participated </nulltag> actively in the <nulltag> regional </nulltag> seminars organized by the Special Committee. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> section 1 
It is <nulltag> undeniable </nulltag> that <nulltag> fostering </nulltag> future <nulltag> generations </nulltag> of South Sudanese who are well nourished, healthy and educated is a precondition for sustainable development and for the effective rule of law, whereby all are equal before the law and are able to demand that their rights be upheld. 
The <nulltag> central </nulltag> <nulltag> bank </nulltag> <nulltag> maintains </nulltag> a dual exchange rate system, with the official exchange rate at 3 South Sudanese pounds to the United States dollar, while the market rate is rapidly depreciating, having reached around 9 pounds to the dollar.

<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the 7445th meeting of the Security Council 
The <nulltag> Commission </nulltag> <nulltag> heard </nulltag> a statement by the Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council on the contribution of population and development issues to the theme of the <nulltag> annual </nulltag> ministerial review in 2015. 
As the <nulltag> international </nulltag> <nulltag> community </nulltag> <nulltag> charts </nulltag> a course for the post-2015 era, population dynamics and reproductive health are central to sustainable development and must be an integral part of development planning and poverty reduction strategies. 
The <nulltag> framework </nulltag> for the implementation of <nulltag> international </nulltag> sanctions in the Republic of Lithuania is <nulltag> established </nulltag> by the Law on the Implementation of Economic and Other International Sanctions (2004). 
<nulltag> Underscoring </nulltag> that any use or <nulltag> threat </nulltag> of use of <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> weapons would seriously undermine the very foundations, integrity, credibility and thus sustainability of the Treaty and would be contrary to its object and purpose, 
<nulltag> Therefore, </nulltag> as any use or threat of use of <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> weapons would be contrary to <nulltag> Article </nulltag> 2 (4) of the Charter of the United Nations, the general principles of international law and the rules and regulations of international humanitarian law and would constitute a crime against humanity, there should be an assurance against the use or threat of use of these illegal, inhumane and illegitimate weapons. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Chamber's </nulltag> initiatives <nulltag> contributed </nulltag> indirectly to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
The <nulltag> activities </nulltag> of the Institute are primarily <nulltag> focused </nulltag> on raising awareness about <nulltag> human </nulltag> rights violations around the world. 
<nulltag> Thirty-two </nulltag> <nulltag> States </nulltag> have performed or will have performed the maximum amount of three reviews. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Mission of Estonia to the United Nations <nulltag> presents </nulltag> its compliments to the Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014) and has the honour to refer to the note verbale dated 11 March 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Working </nulltag> Group <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> to recommend that the President of the Security Council transmit a letter to IGAD: 
3. The <nulltag> members </nulltag> of the Working Group <nulltag> noted </nulltag> the progress that was made by the Government of South Sudan, between independence and November 2013, in protecting children affected by <nulltag> armed </nulltag> conflict, including the signing of action plans. 
27. <nulltag> However, </nulltag> progress has been uneven and there <nulltag> remain </nulltag> <nulltag> significant </nulltag> gaps in primary HIV prevention for women, including unmet needs for family planning services for women of reproductive age and women living with HIV, particularly in high-burden countries. 
<nulltag> Taking </nulltag> into <nulltag> account </nulltag> that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, being a strictly <nulltag> civilian </nulltag> mission, has neither means nor tools at its disposal to ensure compliance by all signatories with the commitments undertaken under the Minsk agreements, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> on the <nulltag> decision </nulltag> of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine on the address to the United Nations and the European Union on the deployment of a peacekeeping and security operation in the territory of Ukraine adopted on 18 February 2015, 
7. Also <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> <nulltag> reform </nulltag> efforts undertaken by the Unit to better serve the interests of the participating organizations and the Member States, and encourages the Unit to continue its efforts, including on selection of the subjects for its programme of work; 
One <nulltag> F-505 </nulltag> <nulltag> Turkish </nulltag> corvette <nulltag> violated </nulltag> the territorial waters of the Republic of Cyprus and illegally used the closed port of Ammochostos while participating in naval exercises of the occupation forces. 
To that <nulltag> end, </nulltag> the <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations system could support Member States in devising <nulltag> national </nulltag> reporting mechanisms and modalities and in providing analysis to identify barriers to effective implementation. 
48. <nulltag> ESCWA </nulltag> <nulltag> convened </nulltag> the <nulltag> twentieth </nulltag> meeting of the Regional Coordination Mechanism for the Arab region on 11 December 2014 in Beirut. 
In all other <nulltag> respects </nulltag> the <nulltag> Organization's </nulltag> <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> financial regulations and rules shall apply.

<nulltag> Particular </nulltag> <nulltag> emphasis </nulltag> was <nulltag> laid </nulltag> on mechanisms to ensure systematic gender mainstreaming throughout all policies and programmes. 
In that <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> it was <nulltag> suggested </nulltag> that there was a need for investment to increase <nulltag> statistical </nulltag> capacity to measure and understand gender inequality in a comprehensive manner and to monitor progress and evaluate the implementation of all the sustainable development goals for women and girls. 
I should be <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> if you would <nulltag> bring </nulltag> the present <nulltag> letter </nulltag> and its annex to the attention of the members of the Security Council.

13. In <nulltag> terms </nulltag> of <nulltag> structural </nulltag> reforms, some Governments are <nulltag> taking </nulltag> measures to strengthen their public finances, especially in the area of tax reform. 
<nulltag> Governments </nulltag> should also <nulltag> create </nulltag> an <nulltag> enabling </nulltag> environment for the private sector to act as the main engine of growth, comprising strong legal and regulatory frameworks, better coordination and accountability of institutions, and macroeconomic and financial stability through prudent policies. 
<nulltag> Such </nulltag> <nulltag> practices </nulltag> have <nulltag> created </nulltag> a fertile environment for terrorism, and they are fanning the flames of extremism and sectarianism.

<nulltag> States </nulltag> should <nulltag> take </nulltag> advantage of <nulltag> coordinated </nulltag> border-management methods as they relate to porous borders, incorporate relevant information and communications technologies, work closely with border communities and develop effective regional cross-border cooperation.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> on the coordinated implementation of the Habitat Agenda 
In my <nulltag> remarks </nulltag> <nulltag> last </nulltag> week to the Security Council, I <nulltag> described </nulltag> how Hezbollah, backed by Iran, is openly operating in the Golan Heights and preparing for a violent confrontation with Israel. 
<nulltag> Israel </nulltag> <nulltag> holds </nulltag> the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> Government responsible for all attacks originating from its territory. 
19. <nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Munnigh <nulltag> reiterated </nulltag> the <nulltag> important </nulltag> role of trade as a key enabler and means to achieve inclusive economic growth and sustainable development. 
One of the most <nulltag> promising </nulltag> <nulltag> possibilities </nulltag> of <nulltag> overcoming </nulltag> the supply bottlenecks in infrastructure for Armenia, a landlocked country, was to promote a more efficient use of existing infrastructure. 
8. <nulltag> Further </nulltag> <nulltag> requests </nulltag> the Secretary-General to <nulltag> provide, </nulltag> in his next report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors concerning United Nations peacekeeping operations, a full explanation for the delays in the implementation of all outstanding recommendations of the Board, the root causes of the recurring issues and the measures to be taken; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of them are <nulltag> Parties </nulltag> to the NPT, the provisions of which they <nulltag> comply </nulltag> with thoroughly.

We <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> that the <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations Forum on Forests, with its <nulltag> universal </nulltag> membership and comprehensive mandate, plays a vital role in addressing challenges and issues relating to forests in a holistic and integrated manner and in promoting policy coordination and cooperation to achieve the sustainable management of all types of forests. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Rule </nulltag> 3 of the rules of procedure of the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons provides: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> composition </nulltag> of the Chamber, in order of precedence, is as follows: Judge Lucky, President; Judges Marotta Rangel, Wolfrum, Ndiaye, Yanai, Kateka, Gao, Kulyk and Heidar, members. 
<nulltag> Earnest </nulltag> <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> should be <nulltag> made </nulltag> to promote the universality of the IAEA comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. 
<nulltag> Here, </nulltag> we <nulltag> reiterate </nulltag> our call for accountability for these crimes committed against the <nulltag> Palestinian </nulltag> people, including our innocent children, who are being traumatized daily by the Israeli occupation and whose futures are in jeopardy of being completely lost if such Israeli impunity is not brought to a halt. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> emergency <nulltag> special </nulltag> session 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> though the <nulltag> adoption </nulltag> of an amendment to the Convention <nulltag> proved </nulltag> impossible, the Contracting Parties decided on principles, expressed in the Vienna Declaration on Nuclear Safety, to guide them in the implementation of the Convention. 
At all the <nulltag> meetings, </nulltag> Switzerland <nulltag> emphasized </nulltag> the importance of strengthening the security of all <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> material, including military materials. 
6. Under <nulltag> section </nulltag> 2, "Staff costs", savings <nulltag> amounting </nulltag> to Euro315,144 relate mainly to the budget lines "established posts" and <nulltag> "common </nulltag> staff costs".

5. The 1995 <nulltag> Review </nulltag> and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons <nulltag> placed </nulltag> emphasis on conditions required to secure the effectiveness of the Treaty, now extended indefinitely, through stressing the importance of maintaining <nulltag> parallel </nulltag> progress in nuclear non-proliferation in all its aspects, nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, while pursuing vigorous efforts to attain Treaty universality. 
<nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> Non-Proliferation </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Dialogue </nulltag> with <nulltag> indigenous </nulltag> peoples. 
8. To be <nulltag> credible, </nulltag> negative <nulltag> security </nulltag> assurances should be <nulltag> codified </nulltag> in the framework of a legally binding multilateral agreement banning the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States provided that they are in compliance with the non-proliferation commitments made under Articles II and III of the NPT. 
69. <nulltag> UNOCI </nulltag> <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to work towards <nulltag> full </nulltag> compliance with my zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and other misconduct.

<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> further the <nulltag> extraordinary </nulltag> <nulltag> achievements </nulltag> made by national mapping and space agencies, geodetic commissions, research organizations and universities and other international organizations such as the International Federation of Surveyors, building upon initiatives of the International Association of Geodesy, representing the global geodetic community, in measuring and monitoring changes in the Earth's system on a best-effort basis, including the development of the now adopted International Terrestrial Reference Frame, 
3. <nulltag> Urges </nulltag> Member States to <nulltag> implement </nulltag> <nulltag> open </nulltag> sharing of geodetic data, standards and conventions to contribute to the global reference frame and regional densifications through relevant national mechanisms and intergovernmental cooperation, and in coordination with the International Association of Geodesy;

<nulltag> Draft </nulltag> decision <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> by the Chair of the Committee following <nulltag> informal </nulltag> consultations 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> to the outcome of the Millennium Summit 
<nulltag> Indeed, </nulltag> Israel's participation at a <nulltag> senior </nulltag> and authoritative level in all the five meetings <nulltag> attested </nulltag> to the importance that Israel ascribed to the need to redefine a new regional security paradigm for the Middle East. 
<nulltag> Decisions </nulltag> that <nulltag> seek </nulltag> to circumvent and substitute <nulltag> direct </nulltag> engagement or the building of trust and agreement among regional parties will neither assist a regional process nor hasten a successful outcome. 
I <nulltag> reiterate </nulltag> my <nulltag> previous </nulltag> <nulltag> call </nulltag> on the Government of Iraq to take into consideration the proposal by UNAMI of developing a targeted information campaign focusing on the national archives and of receiving assistance from volunteers to search the archives of different ministries.

11.

<nulltag> Belgium </nulltag> fully <nulltag> supports </nulltag> the rights of States Parties to the <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> use of nuclear energy as enshrined in the NPT. 
By <nulltag> mitigating </nulltag> <nulltag> radio-xenon </nulltag> emissions from civilian <nulltag> applications, </nulltag> future emissions -- which remain a key indicator to monitor and verify nuclear activity -- would be more reliably attributed to nuclear explosions. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the agenda 
Upon enquiry, the <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee was <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that the role of the Chief of the Corrections Assistance Unit (P-5) will be to increase <nulltag> institutional </nulltag> support to the Haitian Prison Administration Directorate at the highest level, including direct intervention with the Minister of Justice and Public Security, the Minister of Finance and the Director General of the Haitian National Police, and to advocate for the adoption of a strategic plan and appropriate budget allocation.

By this <nulltag> resolution, </nulltag> the <nulltag> Organization </nulltag> of Islamic Cooperation expresses grave concern over "the statement made by the Prime Minister of Israel, in which he acknowledged publicly the possession of nuclear weapons by its regime" and "condemns in the <nulltag> strongest </nulltag> terms the possession of nuclear capability by the Israeli regime to develop nuclear arsenals".

If the <nulltag> prices </nulltag> of oil and other commodities <nulltag> remain </nulltag> <nulltag> low </nulltag> over the longer term, commodity-dependent emerging economies, particularly in Africa, South America, Western Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, could face increasing pressures on budgets and external balances.

7. An even <nulltag> bigger </nulltag> <nulltag> gap </nulltag> exists when <nulltag> comparing </nulltag> obligations undertaken by nonnuclear weapon States with obligations undertaken by States that are not party to the Treaty. 
The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> should <nulltag> review </nulltag> the implementation of Treaty obligations in the field of <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> use of nuclear energy, taking into account relevant obligations adopted at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences, and decide on necessary measures for the full implementation of the Treaty. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> is of the view that the Assembly should be <nulltag> provided </nulltag> with the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> assurances by the Secretary-General that any endorsement of the proposed staffing levels contained in the budget report will not have a detrimental effect on the provision of essential maintenance support services to the different mission components. 
We do not <nulltag> agree </nulltag> that the <nulltag> language </nulltag> on technology transfer in this framework can serve as a precedent for <nulltag> future </nulltag> negotiated documents, including any documents relating to the sustainable development goals or the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or any other negotiation in or outside of the United Nations system.

Although the <nulltag> Court </nulltag> did not <nulltag> mention </nulltag> article 31 (3) (a), it made it <nulltag> clear </nulltag> that the mere adoption of a resolution would not be sufficient.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> notes </nulltag> that there remains some confusion regarding articles 96 and 302 of the Constitution and that this has led to a variety of interpretations and even speculations. 
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the fact that the Government resulting from the <nulltag> general </nulltag> elections of 2005 and 2010 has shown the will to implement the spirit of the Arusha Agreement by recognizing that it was enhanced by the Global Ceasefire Agreement signed in 2003 between the Transitional Government and the National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defence of Democracy, which at the time was an armed movement. 
In <nulltag> view </nulltag> of the <nulltag> small </nulltag> number of nominations <nulltag> received </nulltag> to date, I also intend to extend the period of eligibility for the award of the Medal to 1 January 2007, which marks the beginning of my tenure as Secretary-General.

<nulltag> Taking </nulltag> into <nulltag> consideration </nulltag> the existing <nulltag> staffing </nulltag> resources of the Division and the modest increase in evaluation assignments proposed, the Advisory Committee is of the view that the reassignment of one additional post would be sufficient. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Progress </nulltag> <nulltag> requires </nulltag> a <nulltag> willing </nulltag> partner and we encourage Russia to join us in negotiating these next steps toward meeting our Article VI commitment.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> Introduction 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Council Committee <nulltag> established </nulltag> pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014) 
To be <nulltag> held </nulltag> in <nulltag> private </nulltag> on <nulltag> Monday, </nulltag> 16 March 2015, at 3 p.m. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Tuesday, </nulltag> 28 April 2015, at 10 a.m. 
The <nulltag> General </nulltag> Assembly subsequently <nulltag> decided </nulltag> that Habitat III would be held in Quito during the week of 17 October 2016 and that the <nulltag> third </nulltag> session of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) would be held in Indonesia in July 2016. 
24. In December 2014, <nulltag> UN-Habitat </nulltag> <nulltag> launched </nulltag> a multi-stakeholder initiative to develop guidelines for city climate action plans, with a target launch date for version 1.0 planned for December 2015, at the <nulltag> twenty-first </nulltag> session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris.

<nulltag> Noting </nulltag> that this <nulltag> resolution </nulltag> focuses on the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of <nulltag> small </nulltag> arms and light weapons, including in respect of Council-mandated arms embargoes, 
9. <nulltag> Reaffirms </nulltag> its responsibility to monitor the implementation of <nulltag> Council-mandated </nulltag> arms embargoes and <nulltag> reaffirms </nulltag> its intention to take appropriate measures, when needed, to strengthen arms embargo monitoring mechanisms including inter alia through assigning dedicated staff, monitoring units to relevant United Nations Missions to effectively monitor arms embargoes; 
<nulltag> Crimea </nulltag> was, is and will <nulltag> remain </nulltag> an <nulltag> integral </nulltag> part of the sovereign territory of Ukraine. 
The <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> urges </nulltag> all sides to refrain from any further use of military force, any <nulltag> offensive </nulltag> military actions and other uses of violence. 
It is also <nulltag> noteworthy </nulltag> that the <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations and all of its agencies have always had the policy and practice of <nulltag> using </nulltag> the correct name, i.e., Persian Gulf, as the only geographical designation applicable to this body of water. 
The United States also is a <nulltag> signatory </nulltag> to the <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> Protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, and the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, and has <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> these Protocols to the United States Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. 
We <nulltag> look </nulltag> forward to the <nulltag> results </nulltag> of the <nulltag> global </nulltag> study on children deprived of their liberty in this regard; 
11. As we <nulltag> continue </nulltag> our <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> to achieve the objectives set forth in this Declaration, to enhance <nulltag> international </nulltag> cooperation, to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that our crime prevention and criminal justice systems are effective, fair, humane and accountable, we reaffirm the importance of adequate, long-term, sustainable and effective technical assistance and capacity-building policies and programmes.

2. The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> Republic of the Congo 
<nulltag> Reaffirming </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Copenhagen </nulltag> Declaration on Social Development, the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development and other <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> internationally agreed instruments constitute, together with the global dialogue on this issue, the basic framework for the promotion of social development for all at the national and international levels, 
<nulltag> Whereas, </nulltag> on the matter specifically of article 7 (1) of chapter I on the <nulltag> constitutional </nulltag> principles for the Constitution of the post-transition <nulltag> period, </nulltag> the Bureau of the Committee notes that no agreement was obtained on the mode of election of the President, as the system of politically alternating presidents was considered unworkable, democratically unsustainable or even a source of instability; 
And other <nulltag> texts, </nulltag> notably the <nulltag> national </nulltag> unity charter <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> by referendum in February 1991, inspired the Burundian drafter without thereby becoming supraconstitutional;

<nulltag> Official </nulltag> <nulltag> communiqué </nulltag> of the 7429th (closed) meeting of the Security Council 
While arms <nulltag> embargoes, </nulltag> which in most <nulltag> cases </nulltag> include <nulltag> small </nulltag> arms and light weapons, are the most frequently applied United Nations sanctions measure, their successful implementation remains a challenge. 
All <nulltag> violations </nulltag> <nulltag> committed </nulltag> by the Houthi militias and their allies are <nulltag> consistent </nulltag> with their continued violence since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen, and their refusal to return to legitimacy and abide by the relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 2216 (2015). 
4. At 1930 <nulltag> hours </nulltag> on 24 Rajab A.H. 1436 (13 May A.D. 2015), 10 members of the Houthi terrorist group <nulltag> attempted </nulltag> to infiltrate Saudi Arabian territory <nulltag> opposite </nulltag> border marker 236. (Jazan sector 3)

<nulltag> Acknowledging </nulltag> the <nulltag> fact </nulltag> that the International Criminal Court has achieved <nulltag> considerable </nulltag> progress in its investigations and judicial proceedings in various situations and cases which were referred to it by States parties to the Rome Statute and by the Security Council, and which the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has initiated proprio motu, in accordance with the Rome Statute, 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> further recommends that the General Assembly <nulltag> request </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to build on experience gained in the provision of shared services as a result of the implementation of the global field support strategy, the lessons learned and the work done thus far in this regard, including the Secretary-General's latest proposals. 
<nulltag> Strategic </nulltag> <nulltag> direction, </nulltag> operational policy and guidance <nulltag> development, </nulltag> operational standards and systems standardization, new mission planning, oversight and compliance, quality assurance, senior leadership, field capacity-building, field advocacy in policy decisions, Member State interaction

<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in Libya (22 February 2011; 27 March 2015). 
The <nulltag> dates </nulltag> <nulltag> given </nulltag> for each item indicate when the item was first taken up by the Council at a formal meeting, and the most <nulltag> recent </nulltag> formal Council meeting held on that item. 
Once fully <nulltag> operational, </nulltag> those <nulltag> forces </nulltag> could provide a <nulltag> critical </nulltag> start-up capacity for responding to African crises as bridging mechanisms, as well as for providing enforcement action, if required. 
The <nulltag> NATO </nulltag> International Security Force in Kosovo (KFOR), <nulltag> deployed </nulltag> as the <nulltag> international </nulltag> security presence alongside UNMIK, maintains some 5,000 troops on the ground and performs the role of the third emergency responder, after the Kosovo Police and EULEX.

Under this <nulltag> multi-year </nulltag> <nulltag> programme, </nulltag> the first session of the Commission <nulltag> following </nulltag> a congress would transmit the outcomes and recommendations of the congress and begin consultations on preparation for the next congress. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> for <nulltag> 2014-2015 </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Several </nulltag> <nulltag> Iranians </nulltag> <nulltag> holding </nulltag> student visas set up eight separate shell companies in the State concerned in 2013 and 2014 in order to access at least $150 million of oil export revenues in accounts held by the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran at a State-owned bank. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> President </nulltag> hereby <nulltag> circulates </nulltag> the report dated 1 June 2015 received from the Panel of Experts (see annex). 
<nulltag> Consideration </nulltag> of the outcomes of the study of the <nulltag> transnational </nulltag> nature of and routes <nulltag> used </nulltag> in trafficking in firearms (continued) 
25. The <nulltag> Committee, </nulltag> <nulltag> assisted </nulltag> by the Executive Directorate, will continue its <nulltag> close </nulltag> cooperation with the relevant entities of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, relevant Security Council subsidiary bodies and relevant international, regional and subregional organizations aimed at enhancing the capacity of Member States to fully implement resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), taking into account the new requirements set out in resolution 2178 (2014), and at facilitating the delivery of technical assistance. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the text with the following: 
The <nulltag> State </nulltag> of Qatar being the Chair of the <nulltag> thirty-fifth </nulltag> session of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, I <nulltag> write </nulltag> to bring to your attention the following: 
This <nulltag> confirms </nulltag> once again that the <nulltag> Houthi </nulltag> militias continue to defy <nulltag> international </nulltag> law's legitimacy and refuse to engage in the political process in Yemen, causing a serious escalation of the crisis in Yemen and a severe deterioration of the humanitarian situation, which consists of a further violation of the above-mentioned resolution. 
<nulltag> Respective </nulltag> <nulltag> roles </nulltag> and responsibilities for air operations management 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> UNCDF </nulltag> <nulltag> provided </nulltag> support to 77 FSPs in 2014, allowing them to increase the value of their loan and savings portfolios. 
<nulltag> Delivery </nulltag> against <nulltag> approved </nulltag> <nulltag> annual </nulltag> spending limits 
<nulltag> Recent </nulltag> <nulltag> studies </nulltag> and assessments, however, <nulltag> indicate </nulltag> that the flow of foreign terrorist fighters into conflict zones is continuing and that more needs to be done to tackle the phenomenon. 
In the <nulltag> months </nulltag> since, much has been <nulltag> accomplished </nulltag> by Member States, the United Nations and other <nulltag> international, </nulltag> regional and subregional organizations to counter the threat. 
This <nulltag> pretentious </nulltag> <nulltag> contention </nulltag> by the Greek Cypriot side <nulltag> ignores </nulltag> the present realities on the ground, namely, the existence of two independent, self-governing States on the island of Cyprus, each exercising sovereignty and jurisdiction within its respective territory. 
52. In <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> 24 of the <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> budget, the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> indicates that the facility in Valencia has reached its maximum capacity and that he has initiated discussions with the host Government to explore options for expanding the current capacity. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Economic </nulltag> and Social Council, 
In <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with the arrangements in the exchange of letters of 20 and 24 December 2013, should other situations <nulltag> warrant </nulltag> the use of one or more <nulltag> additional </nulltag> guard unit(s), especially in regions other than Mogadishu, I will revert to the Council with advice on the supplementary measures that may be required. 
As <nulltag> indicated </nulltag> in these <nulltag> letters, </nulltag> in addition to the protection provided by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the Somali National Security Forces, the Council took note of the proposed arrangements for the establishment of a United Nations guard unit that would form part of the <nulltag> overall </nulltag> security concept by providing "inner ring" static protection for UNSOM and UNSOA facilities and installations in Mogadishu. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the Strategy shall be <nulltag> monitored </nulltag> by the Northern Development Zone Advisory Council, with the support of the competent institutions and authorities. 
One <nulltag> Turkish </nulltag> offshore supply ship <nulltag> violated </nulltag> the <nulltag> territorial </nulltag> waters of the Republic of Cyprus and illegally used the closed port of Ammochostos, having previously participated in illegal seismic surveys within the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus. 
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee notes <nulltag> that, </nulltag> as at 17 March 2015, the cash position of the Mission was <nulltag> $579,300,000, </nulltag> covering the three-month operating cash reserve of $147,285,400, leaving $432,014,600 in remaining cash. 
15. At its 2nd <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> also on 1 June, the <nulltag> Open-ended </nulltag> Meeting of Governmental Experts <nulltag> continued </nulltag> its consideration of agenda item 6. 
It <nulltag> publishes </nulltag> a <nulltag> handbook </nulltag> offering a selection of <nulltag> first-class </nulltag> academic programmes and providing key information to help understand the French academic system. 
<nulltag> Education </nulltag> and training programmes can also <nulltag> benefit </nulltag> from the use of newly developed information technologies (e.g. "virtually improved <nulltag> reality", </nulltag> e-learning tools, distance-learning processes). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> At the <nulltag> European </nulltag> Union level: 
In <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with <nulltag> annex </nulltag> II to the Convention, two thirds of the States parties shall <nulltag> constitute </nulltag> a quorum. 
This <nulltag> arrangement </nulltag> does not <nulltag> prejudice </nulltag> or affect <nulltag> future </nulltag> arrangements for elections. 
The <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> <nulltag> Coalition </nulltag> therefore <nulltag> calls </nulltag> on the Security Council to: 
<nulltag> Such </nulltag> <nulltag> measures </nulltag> are cost-effective and instrumental to <nulltag> save </nulltag> lives, prevent and reduce losses and ensure effective recovery and rehabilitation. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Guiding principles 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> to the <nulltag> conclusion </nulltag> of the talks in Algiers, the Prime Minister of the Niger, Mr. Brigi Raffini, <nulltag> facilitated </nulltag> a meeting of the Coordination leadership in Niamey on 8 March to discuss the draft peace agreement. 
We <nulltag> believe </nulltag> these <nulltag> figures </nulltag> to be <nulltag> gross </nulltag> underestimations. 
Since the <nulltag> issuance </nulltag> of the report of the Advisory Committee, <nulltag> however, </nulltag> the Mission has informed the Secretariat that its <nulltag> operational </nulltag> environment has once again been significantly altered by the facts on the ground in that: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Africa:* draft resolution 
<nulltag> Confirmation </nulltag> that <nulltag> domestic </nulltag> nuclear facilities do not <nulltag> produce </nulltag> fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 
Some of the <nulltag> risks </nulltag> <nulltag> include </nulltag> <nulltag> inadvertent </nulltag> launches owing to technical failure or operator error, the possibility of misinterpretation of early warning data leading to intentional but erroneous launches, failures of and false reports by early warning systems and the use of nuclear weapons by unauthorized actors such as rogue military units, terrorists or cyberattackers; 
In this <nulltag> context </nulltag> the Security Council <nulltag> reiterates </nulltag> its willingness to impose sanctions against those who threaten the <nulltag> peace, </nulltag> security or stability of South Sudan. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee notes that the assessment of the contributions of Member States to the United Nations <nulltag> regular </nulltag> budget for 2014-2015 exceeds the current proposal of the Secretary-General on revised estimates for the requirements of UNMEER by more than $13.6 million. 
12. <nulltag> Reiterates </nulltag> its <nulltag> request </nulltag> to the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> and the other executive heads of the participating organizations to fully assist the Unit with the timely provision of all information requested by it; 
6. <nulltag> Underline </nulltag> the importance of the right to access information <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> <nulltag> public </nulltag> policies, strategic planning and decision-making processes; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights <nulltag> provides </nulltag> for the right to freedom of movement. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> inform </nulltag> you that, under the presidency of Lithuania, the Security Council is scheduled to hold an <nulltag> open </nulltag> debate on the protection of journalists in conflict situations. 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> it <nulltag> strengthened </nulltag> partnership frameworks, linking the <nulltag> private </nulltag> sector with the development policy through concession agreements and establishing a specialized Development Bank of Mongolia to mobilize new development financing sources in addition to budget resources. 
Furthermore, the <nulltag> medium-term </nulltag> fiscal <nulltag> framework </nulltag> and annual guidelines are <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> by the State Great Khural at its spring session and on the basis of those the annual general and central Government budgets are developed. 
To <nulltag> allow </nulltag> the <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations to ensure harmonization with national priorities articulated in the <nulltag> new </nulltag> national development plan. 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> its <nulltag> endorsement, </nulltag> in resolution 2066 (2012), of the Secretary-General's recommendation to decrease the <nulltag> military </nulltag> strength of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in three phases between August 2012 and July 2015, 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> its <nulltag> previous </nulltag> resolutions concerning the <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in Liberia and the subregion, in particular resolutions 1509 (2003), 2066 (2012), 2116 (2013), 2176 (2014), 2177 (2014) and 2190 (2014), 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
6. <nulltag> Algeria </nulltag> remains <nulltag> convinced </nulltag> that disarmament and non-proliferation of <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> weapons and all weapons of mass destruction are vital to preserve and consolidate international peace and security and for socio-economic development. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> II 
23. <nulltag> OHCHR </nulltag> is <nulltag> investigating </nulltag> reports of the execution by government forces and <nulltag> affiliated </nulltag> militias of at least 22 civilians, including 3 women and 3 children, following their takeover of the village of Raitan, in Aleppo governorate. 
On the <nulltag> basis </nulltag> of the assessment <nulltag> provided </nulltag> to him by both missions, the Special Envoy will review whether conditions are in place for the implementation of the freeze initiative for an <nulltag> initial </nulltag> six-week period. 
<nulltag> Final </nulltag> <nulltag> report </nulltag> of the Credentials Committee 
108. Since 2015 <nulltag> coincides </nulltag> with the African Union's Year for Women's Empowerment and Development towards Agenda 2063, the <nulltag> twentieth </nulltag> anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and the midpoint of the African Women's Decade, the United Nations system should further <nulltag> strengthen </nulltag> its coordination and enhance its support towards accelerating the implementation of all commitments relating to gender equality and women's empowerment made in these frameworks. 
<nulltag> Following </nulltag> the <nulltag> adoption </nulltag> of Agenda 2063 by the African Union at the <nulltag> twenty-fourth </nulltag> ordinary session of its Assembly, in January 2015, the United Nations has been working to refocus its partnership with the African Union and strengthen the Regional Coordination Mechanism in order to support the Strategic Plan 2014-2017 of the African Union Commission and the 10-Year Implementation Plan for Agenda 2063. 
11. It is <nulltag> acknowledged </nulltag> that there is a <nulltag> difference </nulltag> in the ratio of girls and boys in terms of types of <nulltag> special </nulltag> secondary and vocational training institutions attended and in their enrolment in higher learning, baccalaureate programmes and master's programmes (paras. 189 and 192). 
With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to interventions by indigenous peoples on unresolved land rights, <nulltag> including </nulltag> the Six Nations of the Grand River and others on which the Forum has made <nulltag> specific </nulltag> recommendations in the past, the Forum calls upon States to fairly and equitably redress the long-standing unresolved land rights issues through good-faith negotiations, consistent with the United Nations Declaration and without extinguishing indigenous peoples' land rights. 
30. <nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Inter-Agency </nulltag> Support Group on Indigenous Issues will play a <nulltag> central </nulltag> role in coordinating efforts among United Nations agencies to translate the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples into meaningful change, the Permanent Forum requests that the Group ensure that its membership includes all United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, including specialized agencies. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> is a manifestation of racism, xenophobia and <nulltag> religious </nulltag> intolerance. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> we <nulltag> reaffirm </nulltag> that <nulltag> Holocaust </nulltag> denial is a form of anti-Semitism. 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> we are <nulltag> convinced </nulltag> that the only <nulltag> absolute </nulltag> guarantee against the use or threatened use of such weapons and the risk that they might be used by terrorists is the prohibition and total elimination of nuclear weapons. 
He <nulltag> articulates </nulltag> how sexual violence is integrally linked with the <nulltag> objectives, </nulltag> <nulltag> ideology </nulltag> and funding of extremist groups, noting that women's empowerment and sexual violence prevention should therefore be central to the international response. 
Throughout <nulltag> history, </nulltag> sexual <nulltag> violence </nulltag> has been widespread in armed conflict and <nulltag> continues </nulltag> to have devastating consequences for women, men, boys and girls and their families and communities. 
The <nulltag> decrease </nulltag> of $164,700 under posts is <nulltag> due </nulltag> to the <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> abolition of one General Service (Other level) post under programme support. 
<nulltag> Nuclear-Weapon-Free </nulltag> <nulltag> Zone </nulltag> in Central Asia 
The <nulltag> inalienable </nulltag> <nulltag> right </nulltag> to <nulltag> develop </nulltag> research, production and uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes: working paper submitted by the Islamic Republic of Iran 
In <nulltag> collaboration </nulltag> with Minority Rights Group International, an <nulltag> online </nulltag> course on the participation of minorities in United Nations and national programming processes will be <nulltag> launched </nulltag> in 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> online courses on the use of technology for development and on the data revolution are also under development. 
The <nulltag> course </nulltag> <nulltag> addressed </nulltag> the principles of the <nulltag> organizational </nulltag> resilience management system, as well as current priorities arising in the global humanitarian agenda. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> item(s) 
The additional <nulltag> requirements </nulltag> are <nulltag> attributable </nulltag> primarily to the additional travel cost for two staff members to <nulltag> attend </nulltag> the Senior Mission Administration and Resource Training (SMART) Programme implementation of the train-the-trainer policy. 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States Mission immediately <nulltag> began </nulltag> working on the information that it received in the note verbale informing it of the blockage of funds that had occurred the <nulltag> previous </nulltag> year. 
There were also <nulltag> discussions </nulltag> on steps in the direction of pledges on the non-use of force, <nulltag> including </nulltag> <nulltag> unilateral </nulltag> statements by all relevant stakeholders. 
I <nulltag> urge </nulltag> the <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> <nulltag> authorities </nulltag> to take pragmatic steps to solve this recurring problem and allow children to cross at convenient and safe locations. 
<nulltag> Please </nulltag> also <nulltag> explain </nulltag> how the maintenance of <nulltag> legal </nulltag> provisions, according to which a woman's testimony is worth half that of a man before a court, in criminal matters and in some civil matters, can be compatible with the aim of eliminating gender-based discrimination and ensuring equality before the law. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> society organizations 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> instructions </nulltag> from my Government, I <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to convey to you the following information: 
This <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> <nulltag> crime </nulltag> is fresh evidence of the great hostility of what some like to <nulltag> call </nulltag> the "moderate armed opposition" to knowledge, culture and education, and of those groups' obscurantist zeal to spread their ideas, which are rooted in ignorance, takfirism and extremism. 
The most <nulltag> recent </nulltag> and unacceptable <nulltag> example </nulltag> of this is the initiation by the Republic of Argentina of legal action against persons and companies involved in the development of the Falkland Islands' hydrocarbon industry under Law No 26.659, as <nulltag> amended </nulltag> in 2013 by Law No 26915, which purports to criminalize those involved in the Falkland Islands' hydrocarbon industry. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> its <nulltag> letter, </nulltag> the Republic of Argentina also <nulltag> calls </nulltag> for negotiations with the United Kingdom. 
<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> that the <nulltag> phase-out </nulltag> of <nulltag> ozone-depleting </nulltag> substances is resulting in a rapid increase in the use and release of high global-warming potential HFCs to the environment, 
We strongly <nulltag> believe </nulltag> that the <nulltag> secure </nulltag> <nulltag> future </nulltag> of humanity, peaceful coexistence, tolerance and reconciliation between nations will be reinforced by the acknowledgement of the past. 
In its <nulltag> advisory </nulltag> <nulltag> opinion </nulltag> on Namibia the International Court of Justice ("ICJ") stated, <nulltag> "when </nulltag> the Security Council adopts a decision under article 25 in accordance with the Charter, it is for member States to comply with that decision [...]. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> also did not <nulltag> discharge </nulltag> its <nulltag> obligations </nulltag> to consult or notify the Court of any impediment to execute the pending requests. 
<nulltag> Last </nulltag> <nulltag> advertised </nulltag> 22 <nulltag> Oct </nulltag> 14, vacancy under review for re-advertising. 
The <nulltag> related </nulltag> <nulltag> transactions </nulltag> and transfers will be <nulltag> effected </nulltag> later in 2015, enabling the fully balanced completion of the project account. 
The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> <nulltag> appreciates </nulltag> the support of the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community and the regional organizations that promptly condemned the attempted coup and called for the respect of constitutionality. 
<nulltag> Countries </nulltag> in conflict or <nulltag> emerging </nulltag> from conflict are encouraged to focus on identifying youth priorities and providing guidance to them, which is <nulltag> key </nulltag> to supporting the critical role that they can play in all peace and security efforts, including mitigating the impact of conflicts on societies. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> herewith the concept paper for the Security Council briefing on the theme "The role of youth in countering <nulltag> violent </nulltag> extremism and promoting peace" (see annex), which will be held on 23 April 2015.

4.6 The State <nulltag> party </nulltag> further submits that the communication should be <nulltag> declared </nulltag> <nulltag> inadmissible </nulltag> ratione materiae and ratione loci under article 4 (2) of the Optional Protocol, given that it considers that Denmark is not responsible under the Convention for the acts of gender-based violence suffered by the author, which means that returning the author to China cannot engage the responsibility of the State party. 
5.1 On 22 <nulltag> July </nulltag> 2013, the author <nulltag> provided </nulltag> <nulltag> new </nulltag> information about additional violations of the Convention by the State party and commented on the State party's observations on admissibility. 
<nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> weapons </nulltag> <nulltag> underpin </nulltag> an unjust and discriminatory international order that fosters instability and insecurity and also hinders social and economic development globally. 
It <nulltag> defined </nulltag> and penalized the <nulltag> production, </nulltag> processing, supplying and use of nuclear material without <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> authorization or for other purposes than those allowed by law (article 20), as well as the export and import of nuclear material without due official license (article 25). 
The <nulltag> discussions </nulltag> were <nulltag> co-chaired </nulltag> by the representatives of the European Union, the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and attended by participants from Georgia, the <nulltag> Russian </nulltag> Federation and the United States of America.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> ambition to <nulltag> terrorize </nulltag> civilians is shared by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). 
It is <nulltag> imperative </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> employ </nulltag> all measures capable of stopping the killing in Syria. 
<nulltag> Moreover, </nulltag> they <nulltag> noted </nulltag> that the <nulltag> above-mentioned </nulltag> international legal frameworks and the criminal justice standards and norms provided a common platform for Member States to counter serious forms of criminal activity, irrespective of differences in legal systems and traditions and that they allowed for flexibility in the development and implementation of crime prevention and criminal justice policies and strategies.

As nuclear <nulltag> deterrence </nulltag> entails <nulltag> preparing </nulltag> for nuclear war, the risk of <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> use is real. 
<nulltag> Emphasizing </nulltag> that the <nulltag> scope </nulltag> of the consequences of a <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> explosion and the associated risks raise profound moral and ethical questions that go beyond debates about the legality of nuclear weapons,

<nulltag> Welcoming </nulltag> the <nulltag> overall </nulltag> progress <nulltag> towards </nulltag> restoring security, peace and stability in Côte d'Ivoire, commending the President and Government of Côte d'Ivoire's continued efforts to stabilize the security situation and promote economic recovery in Côte d'Ivoire and strengthen international and regional cooperation, and notably continued cooperation with the governments of Ghana and Liberia, and calling upon all national stakeholders to work together to consolidate the significant progress made so far and to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict, 
<nulltag> Just </nulltag> hours after the attacks in Sarmin, <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> regime forces <nulltag> launched </nulltag> scud missile attacks in Kafr Takharim, resulting in seven deaths. 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States should fundamentally <nulltag> change </nulltag> its viewpoint on the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> People's Republic of Korea in order to stem the current trend of vicious cycle of confrontation and tension. 
<nulltag> Kerry </nulltag> <nulltag> went </nulltag> the length of pulling up the <nulltag> supreme </nulltag> headquarters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a bid to tarnish the image of the country and to justify the bankrupt "human rights" racket against it. 
<nulltag> Nevertheless, </nulltag> the lack of funding for <nulltag> protection, </nulltag> reintegration and development programmes in LRA-affected areas, <nulltag> including </nulltag> for LRA child returnees, remains a serious challenge.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> believe </nulltag> that this was done to provide a <nulltag> cover </nulltag> for refusal of Israel to attend said conference. 
1. <nulltag> Reiterates </nulltag> its support for the status of <nulltag> permanent </nulltag> neutrality <nulltag> declared </nulltag> by Turkmenistan; 
Even <nulltag> so, </nulltag> if this will enable us to better understand <nulltag> historical </nulltag> <nulltag> issues </nulltag> with their legal aspects and to transform resentment into friendship again, it is natural to approach different discourses with empathy and tolerance and expect a similar attitude from all sides. 
The <nulltag> spirit </nulltag> of the age <nulltag> necessitates </nulltag> <nulltag> dialogue </nulltag> despite differences, understanding by heeding others, evaluating means for compromise, denouncing hatred and praising respect and tolerance. 
1. <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste as at 30 April 2015, <nulltag> including </nulltag> the contributions outstanding in the amount of 2 million United States dollars, representing some 0.2 per cent of the total assessed <nulltag> contributions, </nulltag> notes with concern that only 152 Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

It was <nulltag> suggested </nulltag> that <nulltag> UNICEF </nulltag> country programmes in crisis-prone contexts always include <nulltag> updated </nulltag> emergency preparedness and response plans. 
The <nulltag> Board </nulltag> had <nulltag> taken </nulltag> <nulltag> important </nulltag> decisions to raise the Emergency Programme Fund ceiling, expand the revolving fund of the Vaccine Independence Initiative and affirm the principle of UNICEF engaging with countries transitioning from middle- to high-income status. 
47. The <nulltag> Peace </nulltag> and Security Council and the members of the Security Council <nulltag> noted </nulltag> that the nature of the security environment into which peacekeeping operations are deployed has changed significantly and that the <nulltag> current </nulltag> challenges facing United Nations peacekeeping operations included, in particular, transnational threats, armed non-state actors, illicit trafficking and other related emerging security threats, such as the rise of terrorism and violent extremism. 
31. The <nulltag> Peace </nulltag> and Security Council and the members of the Security Council <nulltag> stressed </nulltag> that there could be no <nulltag> military </nulltag> solution to the current crisis in Libya, and that only dialogue would bring about durable peace, security, stability and reconciliation. 
61. The <nulltag> Forum </nulltag> should <nulltag> craft </nulltag> a <nulltag> new </nulltag> vision and mechanisms for enhancing participation of stakeholders in the work of the international arrangement on forests beyond 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> assessment and reporting could also be part of the mandate of such a mechanism. 
These <nulltag> events </nulltag> are a testament to the savagery not only of the <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> Nusrah Front, but also of the Turkish, Saudi Arabian and Qatari officials who <nulltag> support </nulltag> them. 
7. <nulltag> Recalls </nulltag> its demand that all parties to an armed conflict comply fully with the obligations <nulltag> applicable </nulltag> to them under international law <nulltag> related </nulltag> to the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including journalists, media professionals and associated personnel; 
16. <nulltag> Encourages </nulltag> the <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations and <nulltag> regional </nulltag> and sub-regional organizations to share expertise on good practices and lessons learned on protection of journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in armed conflict and, in close co-operation, to enhance the coherent and effective implementation of applicable international humanitarian law and relevant Security Council resolutions including those on protection of journalist, media professionals and associated personnel in situations of the armed conflict; 
<nulltag> Other </nulltag> <nulltag> knowledge </nulltag> management-related <nulltag> activities </nulltag> include weekly meetings of field presences with their respective desks and ongoing contact with their desk officers, annual consultations of heads of field presences, and lessons-learned exercises conducted by the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Service based on inputs from other parts of the Office which are compiled and made available to all staff on the intranet. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> at <nulltag> times </nulltag> poses challenges for administration and <nulltag> financial </nulltag> management and monitoring in the field presences. 
<nulltag> Requests </nulltag> were also <nulltag> received </nulltag> from staff members, researchers and scholars, who wished to make <nulltag> effective </nulltag> use of the rich documentary archives of the Organization, including landmark speeches, treaties, maps, Trusteeship Council reports and other relevant information sources. 
The <nulltag> seminar </nulltag> was <nulltag> conducted </nulltag> within the framework of the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism <nulltag> (2011-2020). </nulltag> 
In that <nulltag> connection, </nulltag> we should <nulltag> like </nulltag> to reiterate that the United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> Arab Republic established by the Secretary-General in 2013 determined that surface-to-surface rockets armed with sarin gas had been used. 
<nulltag> Given </nulltag> that establishing <nulltag> responsibility </nulltag> for those <nulltag> shocking </nulltag> crimes is not part of the Fact-Finding Mission's mandate, we join those States and international organizations that are calling for the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to identify the persons responsible for those crimes and bring them before an international criminal justice forum.

<nulltag> Such </nulltag> non-inclusive <nulltag> growth, </nulltag> the lack of opportunities and the spillover of violence and insecurity have <nulltag> become </nulltag> the major drivers of emigration from our countries. 
To <nulltag> improve </nulltag> <nulltag> public </nulltag> <nulltag> security </nulltag> and access to justice, the following lines of action are envisaged: 
7. <nulltag> According </nulltag> to <nulltag> information </nulltag> received by the Committee, 71.3 per cent of <nulltag> domestic </nulltag> violence cases during the period 2010-2013 were charged under article 145 of the Penal Code and 53 per cent of the sentences handed down under article 145 were suspended. 
8. Also requests the Secretary-General to <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> that the <nulltag> deployment </nulltag> of Umoja Extension 2 addresses the <nulltag> current </nulltag> shortcomings regarding the visibility of and the internal flow of information in the Programme Planning and Budget Division of the Department of Management of the Secretariat, and in this regard also requests the Secretary-General to review the data requirements of the Division and of the Treasury and to integrate those requirements in the design of the budget formulation module; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> and Distribution Unit 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> travel 
6. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> that office accommodation will be <nulltag> adjustable </nulltag> for various <nulltag> staffing </nulltag> requirements, including through the use of shared areas within the facility without increasing its overall size, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide information on this matter in the context of future progress reports; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the report of the Secretary-General; 
The number of <nulltag> air </nulltag> traffic controllers has been <nulltag> increased </nulltag> in accordance with the increasing number of flights over the years, and the Ercan Area Control Centre is in <nulltag> regular </nulltag> and close cooperation with the Ankara Area Control Centre in order to ensure the safe conduct of all flights in the region. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> order </nulltag> to <nulltag> set </nulltag> the record straight, I would like to bring the following to your kind attention. 
In the <nulltag> light </nulltag> of your <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> mission of good offices, which was <nulltag> mandated </nulltag> by the General Assembly and its Special Committee on decolonization, I ask you to urge the United Kingdom to sit at the negotiating table, in compliance with General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX), adopted 50 years ago and reiterated in more than 40 General Assembly resolutions, and as recommended by the Special Committee. 
8. The <nulltag> facilitator </nulltag> <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> an <nulltag> inclusive </nulltag> approach in order to ensure that the views of all regional States were taken into account in the consultative process. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the report of the Secretary-General on further <nulltag> strengthening </nulltag> the work of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters; 
8. <nulltag> Recommends </nulltag> that the <nulltag> third </nulltag> International Conference on Financing for Development, to be <nulltag> held </nulltag> in Addis Ababa from 13 to 16 July 2015, give due consideration to issues relating to the strengthening of institutional arrangements to promote international cooperation in tax matters, including the proposal to upgrade the Committee of Experts to an intergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council; 
It also <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the <nulltag> entry </nulltag> into force of the Africa-Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty), which it was the <nulltag> third </nulltag> African country to ratify on 11 February 1998. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> application </nulltag> to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia with notice to all <nulltag> parties, </nulltag> the agreement may be filed with the Court. 
Where a <nulltag> legislative </nulltag> <nulltag> framework </nulltag> <nulltag> exists, </nulltag> a commercial settlement agreement needs to address commercial disputes, that is, the subject matter does not cover family or household disputes. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> wider </nulltag> acknowledgment of the mandate of UN-Women within the United Nations system has <nulltag> contributed </nulltag> to increased requests for support to promote gender equality through guidance and advice. 
With approximately 40 <nulltag> countries </nulltag> <nulltag> rolling </nulltag> out <nulltag> new </nulltag> United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks in 2015, sustaining the availability of United Nations expertise on gender equality to United Nations country teams and their partners will be a key part of the coordination role of UN-Women. 
The <nulltag> Deputy </nulltag> also <nulltag> oversees </nulltag> the <nulltag> strategic </nulltag> planning and evaluation functions of the Office, serves as the Chair of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Working Group, acts for the Coordinator in his or her absence and represents him or her, as required, in United Nations bodies, organizations and conferences. 
51. A <nulltag> plethora </nulltag> of institutions <nulltag> exist </nulltag> to promote <nulltag> regional </nulltag> cooperation in taking on common development challenges and in formulating more effective and comprehensive responses. 
It can <nulltag> promote </nulltag> <nulltag> infrastructure </nulltag> development and shared transport networks (e.g., transport corridors), which are <nulltag> crucial </nulltag> for many countries, especially countries in such special situations as landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, if they are to participate in the global economy and join global value chains. 
There is <nulltag> recognition </nulltag> of the importance of <nulltag> holding </nulltag> such workshops and events in order to continually <nulltag> update </nulltag> and exchange information on the experience of others and how the test of feasibility is being interpreted in different operating conditions. 
In the foam <nulltag> sector, </nulltag> 3.9 per <nulltag> cent </nulltag> of the <nulltag> total </nulltag> GWP-weighted tonnes CO2 equivalent is for polyurethane foam and extruded polystyrene foam represents about 3.2 per cent. 
<nulltag> Taking </nulltag> note of the Moroccan proposal presented on 11 April 2007 to the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> and welcoming serious and credible Moroccan <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> to move the process forward towards resolution; also taking note of the Polisario Front proposal presented 10 April 2007 to the Secretary-General, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> parties </nulltag> to continue cooperating with the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees in implementing the January 2012 updated Plan of Action on Confidence Building Measures, 
<nulltag> Iran </nulltag> <nulltag> believes </nulltag> that there could never be a <nulltag> military </nulltag> solution to the conflict and the foreign aggression against Yemeni people has only exacerbated the situation. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> (a) </nulltag> <nulltag> (i) </nulltag> b 
A <nulltag> bill </nulltag> on Witness Protection was being <nulltag> drafted </nulltag> at the time of the country visit and included <nulltag> comprehensive </nulltag> protections, including active protection measures. 
<nulltag> Section </nulltag> 13(2) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and section 28A(1) of the Bribery Act <nulltag> provide </nulltag> for protection of the rights of <nulltag> bona </nulltag> fide third parties in confiscation proceedings. 
29H.15 Under the <nulltag> framework </nulltag> of <nulltag> system-wide </nulltag> coherence, the Office <nulltag> coordinates </nulltag> regularly with other United Nations oversight entities, including the Board of Auditors, and the Joint Inspection Unit, to ensure that potential gaps and unnecessary duplication and overlap in oversight work are minimized. 
I <nulltag> note </nulltag> that a <nulltag> parliamentary </nulltag> <nulltag> quorum </nulltag> was observed on 5 November, when Lebanese politicians met to extend the mandate of the Parliament until June 2017. 
To that <nulltag> end, </nulltag> they <nulltag> reaffirmed </nulltag> their commitment, as stated in article VI of the NPT, to pursue in <nulltag> good </nulltag> faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament. 
Those <nulltag> measures </nulltag> were not <nulltag> specific </nulltag> provisions of the Treaty, but were at the centre of the debates during the preparatory work prior to its adoption and the commitments subsequently <nulltag> assumed </nulltag> by the States parties. 
Since the <nulltag> proclamation </nulltag> of Ukraine's independence in 1991, the Government of Ukraine has <nulltag> made </nulltag> efforts to provide Crimean Tatars with the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> resources for their resettlement and integration into the Ukrainian society. 
<nulltag> According </nulltag> to <nulltag> surveys </nulltag> conducted by Crimean Tatar activists in the 1960s, more than 109,956 <nulltag> (46.2 </nulltag> per cent) of the 238,500 Crimean Tatar deportees died between 1 July 1944 and 1 January 1947 as a result of starvation and disease. 
During its two <nulltag> previous </nulltag> <nulltag> terms </nulltag> (2006-2009 and 2010-2013), Switzerland undertook, in close cooperation with other States and civil society partners, to <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> that the Human Rights Council would become a strong and effective institution. 
It <nulltag> constitutes </nulltag> the <nulltag> first </nulltag> <nulltag> part </nulltag> of the report of the Secretary-General on developments and issues relating to ocean affairs and the law of the sea for consideration by the Assembly at its seventieth session. 
The <nulltag> Convention </nulltag> also <nulltag> provides </nulltag> a basis for <nulltag> modern </nulltag> communications by setting out a regime related to the laying of submarine cables (see paras. 53-55 below). 
<nulltag> According </nulltag> to the <nulltag> response </nulltag> provided by the Secretariat, the process referred to in the statute, even if "streamlined", would be a <nulltag> time-consuming </nulltag> and resource-heavy project, and that the remaining time frame of three and a half months (from the adoption of the resolution to 18 July 2015) was considered to be tight. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
He bluntly <nulltag> threatens </nulltag> to use this <nulltag> inhumane </nulltag> weapon against Iran, shrugging off the <nulltag> possible </nulltag> fatalities that would be in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions. 
The <nulltag> speech </nulltag> is <nulltag> reckless </nulltag> in the sense that it directly <nulltag> challenges </nulltag> the fundamental principles of the law of armed conflict and international humanitarian law and undermines international peace and security. 
<nulltag> Clearly, </nulltag> this <nulltag> extremist </nulltag> government is bent on <nulltag> pursuing </nulltag> the aggressive, unlawful measures that have been Israeli policy for decades with the aim of pushing the Palestinian people off their land. 
<nulltag> Such </nulltag> <nulltag> settler </nulltag> depravity is undoubtedly <nulltag> fuelled </nulltag> by the constant provocation and incitement by Israeli political leaders, including members of the new Israeli Government, and by the absolute impunity enjoyed by the settlers, who are never held accountable for their crimes against Palestinians. 
3.10 <nulltag> Furthermore, </nulltag> the authors <nulltag> recall </nulltag> that they have used remedies <nulltag> available </nulltag> before local primary courts in order to attempt to be granted letters of administration, to no avail. 
<nulltag> Rule </nulltag> 5, which pertains to the right to <nulltag> administer </nulltag> the deceased's estates, states that <nulltag> "the </nulltag> administrator of the deceased's property is the eldest brother of the deceased, or his father, and if there is no brother or father, it can be any other male relative chosen with the help of the clan council".

5) The <nulltag> Middle </nulltag> East Nuclear Weapon- and Weapons of Mass Destruction-Free Zone Conference shall <nulltag> meet </nulltag> annually in its <nulltag> plenary </nulltag> format and working groups; 
7) The <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> shall <nulltag> inform </nulltag> the 2020 <nulltag> Review </nulltag> Conference and its preparatory committees on progress made and the status of the implementation of the 1995 Resolution; 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> therefore <nulltag> considered </nulltag> that the degree of risk to <nulltag> public </nulltag> health associated with the liability to abuse of AM-2201 was substantial. 
<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the 7420th meeting of the Security Council 
In <nulltag> developing </nulltag> the <nulltag> new </nulltag> <nulltag> procedure </nulltag> for the extension of contracts it is important to recall the contractors' obligation to carry out exploration in good faith and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the Convention and the Agreement, the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority and the decisions of the relevant organs of the Authority. 
Some <nulltag> members </nulltag> of the Legal and Technical Commission <nulltag> expressed </nulltag> a <nulltag> divergent </nulltag> opinion as to the task and responsibility of the Commission as set forth under section III of the recommendation for the following reasons: 
Parole is <nulltag> regulated </nulltag> principally under the Parole <nulltag> Board </nulltag> Act 1986, and no inmates charged with <nulltag> corruption-related </nulltag> offences have been released on parole in the past five years. 
Overall, the <nulltag> following </nulltag> <nulltag> success </nulltag> and good practice in <nulltag> implementing </nulltag> chapter IV of the Convention is highlighted: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> that <nulltag> connection, </nulltag> the <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs of Eritrea: 
16. At the <nulltag> regional </nulltag> <nulltag> level, </nulltag> Panama <nulltag> commits </nulltag> to: 
16. <nulltag> Awareness </nulltag> of the <nulltag> humanitarian </nulltag> consequences of nuclear weapons and of the <nulltag> compelling </nulltag> case they make for the total elimination of nuclear weapons is not, and should not be, limited to the context of the Treaty. 
7. It is therefore extremely <nulltag> important </nulltag> that transparency be <nulltag> enhanced </nulltag> and reporting be formalized or institutionalized as a concrete <nulltag> measure </nulltag> to ensure transparency in the context of strengthening the review process. 
<nulltag> Resource </nulltag> requirements <nulltag> (before </nulltag> <nulltag> recosting): </nulltag> $27,577,000 
<nulltag> Failure </nulltag> by <nulltag> independent </nulltag> contractors, <nulltag> implementing </nulltag> partners and other third parties to comply with its, his or her obligations, including fraud and other financial irregularities, committed to the detriment of UNFPA. 
They <nulltag> condemned </nulltag> all <nulltag> attacks </nulltag> and reaffirmed their support for making the Abyei Area a <nulltag> weapons-free </nulltag> zone. 
7. <nulltag> Consideration </nulltag> of <nulltag> practical </nulltag> steps to <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> the continued and enhanced effectiveness of national marking, record-keeping and tracing systems in the light of such developments, including ways to support the transfer, uptake and effective utilization of relevant tools and technologies. 
22. It is <nulltag> useful </nulltag> to <nulltag> deconstruct </nulltag> the <nulltag> terms </nulltag> "classified" and "sensitive" in regard to information and information security, and determine the reasons for classification. 
For <nulltag> effective </nulltag> verification of nuclear <nulltag> warhead </nulltag> dismantlement, the verification regime must be capable of <nulltag> generating </nulltag> high confidence regardless of the level of trust between the parties. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> in the <nulltag> future, </nulltag> the Government of Burundi has invited all of its partners to send observers before, during and after the elections. 
The <nulltag> decrease </nulltag> of <nulltag> $3,400 </nulltag> under non-post resources <nulltag> reflects </nulltag> a reduction under travel of staff that takes into account the anticipated impact of the approved standards of accommodation for air travel. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Credentials </nulltag> Committee shall be <nulltag> appointed </nulltag> at the beginning of the Conference. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> acquitted </nulltag> by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, persons released after serving their sentences 
The <nulltag> primary </nulltag> <nulltag> objectives </nulltag> of such a programme should <nulltag> be, </nulltag> among others, to ensure digital access for all, promote "digital literacy and communication", ensure safe and secure communication in the digital environment, promote safeguards for secure e-commerce, ensure the protection of human rights and in particular the right to privacy, and protect from the different manifestations and types of cybercrime. 
We <nulltag> recommend </nulltag> that such a <nulltag> programme </nulltag> be used to raise awareness among all members of society regarding the use of <nulltag> modern </nulltag> technology in a digital environment, the rights and responsibilities of Internet and digital technology users, as well as protection from the criminal misuse of information technologies. 
This <nulltag> led </nulltag> in a <nulltag> deterioration </nulltag> of the health of <nulltag> several </nulltag> persons deprived of their liberty. 
2. <nulltag> Improving </nulltag> <nulltag> transportation </nulltag> facilities between the <nulltag> international </nulltag> seaports of Turkmenbashi and Baku (Alyat) through the use of cargo shipment methods such as "ro-ro" and "ro-pax". 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> the Ministers for Foreign Affairs <nulltag> called </nulltag> on the <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> Ministries and entities to have more efficient trilateral cooperation in order to implement the provisions of the Framework Programme and to exert efforts for its fulfilment. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> However, </nulltag> the <nulltag> following </nulltag> salient developments should be noted: 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> to you a letter dated 14 May 2015 from the representative of the National Coalition of <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> Revolution and Opposition Forces (see annex). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Enrique Peral-Antunez (Renault, France) 
These <nulltag> aims </nulltag> correspond to the purposes of the United Nations in the area of <nulltag> international </nulltag> economic and social cooperation, as <nulltag> specified </nulltag> in Chapter IX of the Charter. 
It further <nulltag> acknowledges </nulltag> that such <nulltag> improvements, </nulltag> which have been recognized by Member States, would not have been <nulltag> possible </nulltag> had OHCHR limited itself to using the existing strategic framework and the Integrated Monitoring and Documentation Information System (IMDIS). 
A 2013 <nulltag> study </nulltag> by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, <nulltag> commissioned </nulltag> by New Zealand and Switzerland and prepared by Hans Kristensen and Matthew McKinzie, Reducing Alert Rates of Nuclear Weapons, was presented at a side event during the discussions of the First Committee at the <nulltag> sixty-seventh </nulltag> session of the Assembly, with a side event held in Geneva in 2013 at the second session of the Preparatory Committee. 
<nulltag> Council </nulltag> members can and must <nulltag> break </nulltag> this deadlock by adopting a <nulltag> new </nulltag> resolution referring the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic to the Court. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council cannot act because of the <nulltag> irresponsible </nulltag> use of the veto, concerned Member States have a legal and moral obligation to act unilaterally. 
<nulltag> UNICEF </nulltag> is also <nulltag> adapting </nulltag> its <nulltag> institutional </nulltag> framework to align with the UN System-wide Action Plan (SWAP) for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, endorsed by the United Nations Chief Executives Board for Coordination in 2012 as a measure to increase accountability and oversight for confirming gender equality results across the United Nations system. 
These <nulltag> services </nulltag> <nulltag> included </nulltag> <nulltag> health, </nulltag> psychosocial and livelihood support, economic strengthening and access to justice. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> Minister </nulltag> for Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Keit Pentus-Rosimannus, <nulltag> stated </nulltag> on 5 May 2015 that "Estonia does not recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh and therefore does not consider the results of the <nulltag> so-called </nulltag> parliamentary election held on 3 May to be legitimate or valid". 
In his <nulltag> statement </nulltag> <nulltag> made </nulltag> on 22 April 2015, the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Iyad Ameen Madani, condemned the "elections" in the <nulltag> occupied </nulltag> Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan and stated that the "elections" are illegal and in contravention of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Field </nulltag> visit 
The <nulltag> regional </nulltag> <nulltag> seminars </nulltag> on decolonization have <nulltag> proven </nulltag> to be useful in facilitating the active participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing-Territories and help to mobilize international public opinion in order to increase support and assistance for the peoples of those Territories. 
10. <nulltag> Continued </nulltag> <nulltag> large-scale </nulltag> <nulltag> fighting </nulltag> coupled with expected heavy rains and flooding will also have a heavy impact on nutrition and health service delivery. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations system <nulltag> faced </nulltag> dilemmas and challenges in 2014. 
The <nulltag> Congress </nulltag> has until the end of May 2018 to <nulltag> request </nulltag> the administering Power, by a <nulltag> three-fifths </nulltag> majority of its members (33 members), to hold the referendum on the assumption of full sovereignty. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> position </nulltag> is currently <nulltag> held </nulltag> by Mr. Vincent Bouvier. 
<nulltag> Many </nulltag> of those <nulltag> countries </nulltag> were among the poorest in the world, which, in any case, would be <nulltag> struggling </nulltag> to implement the new development agenda. 
<nulltag> Paragraphs </nulltag> 9 and 12 of resolution 2206 (2015) <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> South Sudan are implemented through the <nulltag> following </nulltag> legislation: 
Extremely <nulltag> concerned </nulltag> by an <nulltag> immediate, </nulltag> indiscriminate, and <nulltag> massive </nulltag> death and destruction caused by any use of nuclear weapons and its long-term catastrophic consequences on human health, the environment and other vital economic resources, thus endangering the life of present and future generations, 
As long as <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> weapons </nulltag> <nulltag> exist, </nulltag> the risk of their possible use or threat of use persists. 
The <nulltag> Institute </nulltag> <nulltag> contributed </nulltag> significantly to the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), particularly in Cambodia, where it developed an implementation guide on law, and conducted four <nulltag> regional </nulltag> workshops on law. 
<nulltag> Representatives </nulltag> <nulltag> attended </nulltag> 11 of the 12 sessions of the <nulltag> joint </nulltag> NGO briefing series held at the United Nations Office at Geneva and various meetings of the twenty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council, also in Geneva, in September 2013. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Drawing of lots 
While it would be <nulltag> futile </nulltag> and self-defeating to <nulltag> deny </nulltag> the <nulltag> allegations </nulltag> in the report or be defensive, two reservations need to be made. 
6. <nulltag> Furthermore, </nulltag> they <nulltag> stressed </nulltag> the need for a <nulltag> comprehensive </nulltag> approach that takes into account the needs of children in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, including the specific needs and capacities of girls. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> While commitments by <nulltag> national </nulltag> <nulltag> Governments </nulltag> are encouraging, there is an urgent need for a more consistent translation of those commitments into robust actions. 
<nulltag> Programmes </nulltag> should be <nulltag> implemented </nulltag> in ways that promote <nulltag> equality, </nulltag> non-discrimination, accountability, and participation and inclusion of key populations and people living with HIV. 
<nulltag> Joint </nulltag> <nulltag> Inspection </nulltag> Unit 
25. It was <nulltag> suggested </nulltag> that the <nulltag> outcome </nulltag> of the <nulltag> third </nulltag> International Conference on Financing for Development should also tackle challenges facing developing countries in mobilizing financial resources owing to unresolved issues relating to international trade and subsidies provided to the agricultural sector in developed countries. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Mechanism </nulltag> <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> to continue focusing on ways to strengthen the positioning of the United Nations system in the region to optimize the support that it provided to all stakeholders in member States, placing sustainability and equality at the centre of the agenda. 
Two <nulltag> primary </nulltag> <nulltag> reasons </nulltag> can <nulltag> lead </nulltag> to a cash surplus: (a) unpredictable or late (but still within the biennium) payment of assessed contributions or (b) savings achieved in the execution of the approved programmes. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> for funding by the MCIF will have been <nulltag> assessed </nulltag> in accordance with the following criteria; that such items: 
<nulltag> Total </nulltag> <nulltag> number </nulltag> of shots: ~ 58,140 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of South-South cooperation was also <nulltag> highlighted. </nulltag> 
7. The most <nulltag> significant </nulltag> public <nulltag> order </nulltag> incident in the reporting period was violence <nulltag> associated </nulltag> with two opposition-led demonstrations on 24 and 27 January. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> No two <nulltag> Inspectors </nulltag> shall be nationals of the same State.

<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> also that the <nulltag> intergovernmental </nulltag> <nulltag> negotiations </nulltag> on the post-2015 development agenda, financing for development, climate change and disaster risk reduction provide the international community with a unique opportunity to enhance coherence across policies, institutions, goals, indicators and measurement systems for implementation, while respecting the respective mandates, and that ensuring credible links, as appropriate, between these processes will contribute to building resilience and achieving the global goal of eradicating poverty, 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> herewith the Riyadh <nulltag> final </nulltag> communiqué, which was issued on 19 May 2015, at the end of the Riyadh Conference on Saving Yemen and Building a Federal State (see annex).

49. With inequalities <nulltag> emerging </nulltag> in <nulltag> many </nulltag> other <nulltag> components </nulltag> of development, "inequality in income" must be distinguished from "inequality of opportunity", which refers to inequalities resulting from circumstances that are beyond an individual's control. 
In <nulltag> Azerbaijan, </nulltag> Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, <nulltag> natural </nulltag> resources <nulltag> rent, </nulltag> defined as the difference between a commodity's price and its average production cost, amounts to between 37 and 47 per cent of GDP.

The <nulltag> Nippon </nulltag> Foundation Grant was <nulltag> invested </nulltag> in a <nulltag> special </nulltag> bank account. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Matters <nulltag> brought </nulltag> to the attention of the Council 
Under the <nulltag> auspices </nulltag> of the Global Protection Cluster, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee has <nulltag> launched </nulltag> an <nulltag> independent </nulltag> "whole system" review. 
<nulltag> Due </nulltag> <nulltag> diligence </nulltag> reviews are not <nulltag> performed </nulltag> by the same individuals responsible for fundraising. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> attach </nulltag> herewith a note verbale addressed to all members of the Security Council, concerning the <nulltag> latest </nulltag> atrocities in the city of Aden brought about by the Houthi militias and elements loyal to former President Saleh (see annex). 
<nulltag> Please </nulltag> <nulltag> include </nulltag> details on progress made in adopting a <nulltag> specific </nulltag> law on domestic violence and violence against women, as well as in ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence and the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> because of <nulltag> opposing </nulltag> views held by members of the Governing Council on the matter, no consensus was reached and, as a result, the governance structure has remained <nulltag> unchanged. </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 5 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> agenda* 
34.29 During the <nulltag> biennium </nulltag> <nulltag> 2016-2017, </nulltag> the following outputs will be <nulltag> delivered </nulltag> (regular budget): 
1. To <nulltag> resolve </nulltag> the <nulltag> crisis </nulltag> in Syria by <nulltag> political </nulltag> means, on the basis of mutual consent and the Geneva principles of 30 June 2012. 
The <nulltag> estimate </nulltag> for the biennium <nulltag> 2016-2017 </nulltag> <nulltag> reflects </nulltag> the full anticipated revenue for that financial period. 
<nulltag> IS2.2 </nulltag> The <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> decrease of $181,700 in rental income is due to the combined decreases in Addis Ababa ($16,000), Bangkok ($125,100) and Headquarters ($48,000), partially <nulltag> offset </nulltag> by an increase in Santiago ($7,400). 
Upon <nulltag> instructions </nulltag> from my Government, I have the honour to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> herewith a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 27 February 2015 in connection with the <nulltag> so-called </nulltag> "elections" to the "parliament" of the puppet separatist regime to be held in the Nagorno-Karabagh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan on 3 May 2015 (see annex). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> number </nulltag> of partner States <nulltag> included </nulltag> in such arrangements range from 4 (Egypt) to 163 (Malaysia). 
As a <nulltag> result </nulltag> of these departures, the <nulltag> legal </nulltag> support team no longer has a member who has <nulltag> worked </nulltag> on the case from its commencement. 
<nulltag> Locating </nulltag> and verifying the <nulltag> identity </nulltag> of witnesses present an <nulltag> additional </nulltag> challenge, especially for those witnesses who testified over a decade ago and have not been in contact with the Tribunal since. 
5. <nulltag> General </nulltag> <nulltag> debate </nulltag> on the contribution of population and development issues to the Economic and Social Council theme in 2016 on <nulltag> "Implementing </nulltag> the post2015 development agenda: moving from commitments to results". 
25.14 In 2014, <nulltag> UNHCR </nulltag> <nulltag> issued </nulltag> its <nulltag> first </nulltag> policy and administrative instructions and procedures for implementation of enterprise risk management. 
Fortunately, the <nulltag> Israel </nulltag> Defense Force <nulltag> disrupted </nulltag> the operation and avoided an escalation that could have further destabilized an already <nulltag> volatile </nulltag> region. 
The <nulltag> members </nulltag> had <nulltag> commended </nulltag> the World Bank Group's commitment to mainstreaming <nulltag> low-carbon </nulltag> development and disaster risk management while maintaining focus on its poverty eradication mandate, and further encouraged efforts and financing to contribute to the success of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> global </nulltag> economic <nulltag> outlook </nulltag> was uneven and there was no room for complacency. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the observations and <nulltag> endorses </nulltag> the recommendations contained in the report of the Board of Auditors; 
<nulltag> Draft </nulltag> resolution <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> by the Chair of the Committee following <nulltag> informal </nulltag> consultations 
<nulltag> Subsequently, </nulltag> WHO <nulltag> hosted </nulltag> a <nulltag> national </nulltag> consultation in Fiji on non-communicable diseases and the law and, with the International Development Law Organization, signed a memorandum to advance global collaboration on health, including diet, physical activity and legislation. 
50. <nulltag> UNDP </nulltag> <nulltag> continues </nulltag> to support the parties in meeting their <nulltag> general </nulltag> obligations under the Framework Convention. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Rapid </nulltag> <nulltag> urbanization </nulltag> notwithstanding, Africa is still the least urbanized continent. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Economic </nulltag> and Social Council <nulltag> decides </nulltag> that: 
We therefore <nulltag> decide </nulltag> to strengthen the <nulltag> current </nulltag> arrangement and establish a <nulltag> strong, </nulltag> more effective and solid arrangement for the period 2015-2030 by making the commitments set out below. 
16. <nulltag> According </nulltag> to a <nulltag> document </nulltag> adopted by the Economic, Social and Cultural Council in October 2013, the <nulltag> territory's </nulltag> economic and administrative activities are heavily concentrated in the island of Tahiti. 
The <nulltag> Polynesian </nulltag> <nulltag> Government, </nulltag> comprising between 7 and 10 ministers, is responsible for <nulltag> guiding </nulltag> the policies of the collectivity. 
14. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> on Disarmament, in Geneva, is the only <nulltag> appropriate </nulltag> forum for negotiations on a treaty <nulltag> banning </nulltag> the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Treaty </nulltag> review process is a <nulltag> major </nulltag> platform for global nuclear governance. 
The <nulltag> Board </nulltag> found, inter <nulltag> alia, </nulltag> that 44 Palestinian civilians had been killed and 227 injured, among them <nulltag> many </nulltag> children, as a direct result of Israeli assaults on United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East schools in which Palestinian civilians had sought safety and shelter during the conflict. 
Every <nulltag> single </nulltag> <nulltag> day, </nulltag> and in countless ways, Palestinian children are victims of Israeli human rights violations, with no child <nulltag> considered </nulltag> too young to be spared the oppression being meted out by the Israeli occupying forces and extremist settlers. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Switzerland </nulltag> <nulltag> remains </nulltag> deeply concerned at the lack of progress in both the Conference on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> pension scheme 
<nulltag> Conditions </nulltag> for the full realization of Treaty objectives therefore heavily <nulltag> depend </nulltag> upon the full implementation of all its obligations, and on its <nulltag> eventual </nulltag> universality. 
In that <nulltag> context, </nulltag> <nulltag> nonproliferation </nulltag> efforts should strictly <nulltag> abide </nulltag> by comprehensive safeguards agreements as the verification standard under the Treaty and consistent with the decision. 
The <nulltag> State </nulltag> of Qatar being the Chair of the <nulltag> thirty-fifth </nulltag> session of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, I have the honour to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> to you herewith a press release on a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Adel al-Jubeir, regarding the humanitarian situation in Yemen (see annex). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Dialogue </nulltag> with United Nations agencies, programmes and funds. 
The <nulltag> number </nulltag> of Ebola treatment centres, laboratories and community care centres in <nulltag> affected </nulltag> countries are <nulltag> shown </nulltag> in table 1 below. 
7. The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Envoy, </nulltag> <nulltag> working </nulltag> closely with WHO, developed in collaboration with the Governments of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone a comprehensive strategic framework for the global Ebola response. 
In any <nulltag> case, </nulltag> nuclear-weapon-free <nulltag> zone </nulltag> status does not <nulltag> cover </nulltag> all regions of the world. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> paper </nulltag> submitted by Algeria* 
There were <nulltag> reports </nulltag> of an <nulltag> increased </nulltag> presence of <nulltag> former </nulltag> combatants in the west of Côte d'Ivoire, as well as in Bouaké, where participation in disarmament and demobilization operations continued to be low. 
In that <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> I <nulltag> welcome </nulltag> efforts to take <nulltag> forward </nulltag> intercommunal dialogue, which is an important tool for advancing social cohesion and reconciliation between communities. 
<nulltag> Acknowledging </nulltag> that the <nulltag> global </nulltag> geodetic <nulltag> reference </nulltag> frame depends upon the participation of countries all around the globe, and the need to take action to strengthen international cooperation, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
It <nulltag> took </nulltag> the <nulltag> Arab </nulltag> Group an <nulltag> additional </nulltag> eight months to agree to participate in the consultations. 
9. To <nulltag> promote </nulltag> any <nulltag> significant </nulltag> regional <nulltag> security </nulltag> architecture in the Middle East, it is imperative that the regional States do not adopt positions that prevent the other side from participating in what should be an inclusive regional process between all relevant stakeholders. 
My <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Representative </nulltag> <nulltag> reassured </nulltag> them that UNAMI, along with the other parties, would work with the tripartite mechanism and proactively seek ways to make all efforts more effective. 
4. In his <nulltag> first </nulltag> <nulltag> trip </nulltag> outside Iraq, my Special Representative <nulltag> visited </nulltag> Kuwait on 27 April. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> <nulltag> (closed), </nulltag> held on 16 March 2015, and 7406th (closed) meeting, held on 17 March 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in Afghanistan (24 January 1994; 16 March 2015) 
19. In this <nulltag> context </nulltag> it is <nulltag> important </nulltag> that countries that have <nulltag> launched, </nulltag> or intend to launch, civil nuclear activities possess sufficient human, material and technical means, supported by an appropriate legal framework, to deal with issues related to the safety and security of civil nuclear materials and facilities, and to prevent terrorist groups gaining access to such materials. 
The <nulltag> dissemination </nulltag> of nuclear technologies and knowledge for <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> purposes should not be <nulltag> assimilated </nulltag> to, or confused with, the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Recommends </nulltag> the provisional <nulltag> rules </nulltag> of procedure for the Conference set forth in annex I to the note and the provisional agenda of the Conference set forth in annex II to the note for adoption at the Conference;

In these <nulltag> circumstances, </nulltag> they are in their "origins or <nulltag> inception" </nulltag> declaratory of such rules, that is to <nulltag> say, </nulltag> "the framers of the treaty identify rules of customary international law existing at the commencement of the drafting of the codification treaty and give these rules expression in the form of jus scriptum". 
3. <nulltag> More </nulltag> than 15 <nulltag> years </nulltag> since its establishment, MONUSCO <nulltag> entered </nulltag> a new phase starting in March 2013.

The <nulltag> legal </nulltag> <nulltag> framework </nulltag> and administrative structures necessary for the conduct of the elections are being <nulltag> put </nulltag> into place as planned. 
The <nulltag> Haitian </nulltag> <nulltag> Government </nulltag> therefore <nulltag> attaches </nulltag> the utmost importance to the maintenance of substantial United Nations assistance for the consolidation of security throughout the electoral cycle, in particular through the visible, robust presence of the military and police components of MINUSTAH, which, by more proactively supporting the initiatives of the National Police of Haiti, would make a most valuable contribution to the success of the next elections. 
During its <nulltag> consideration </nulltag> of the report, the Committee <nulltag> met </nulltag> with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided <nulltag> additional </nulltag> information and clarification, concluding with written responses received on 19 March 2015.

The <nulltag> database </nulltag> <nulltag> addresses </nulltag> seven <nulltag> critical </nulltag> areas of urban law that are essential to the sustainability and development of urban areas. 
<nulltag> ASUD </nulltag> <nulltag> represents </nulltag> one of the most <nulltag> important </nulltag> means for UN-Habitat to address the urbanization process from the new strategic paradigm. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> in this respect <nulltag> urges </nulltag> all States parties to steadily implement the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. 
The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> encourages those States <nulltag> parties, </nulltag> groups of countries and relevant organizations in a position to do so to make contributions to the Initiative or other <nulltag> financial </nulltag> or in-kind contributions to the relevant IAEA activities continuously, including beyond 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of an IAEA <nulltag> owned </nulltag> and operated Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank was approved by the Board of Governors on 3 December 2010. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> has also <nulltag> developed </nulltag> a Nuclear Security Information Management System (NUSIMS). 
At a <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> <nulltag> held </nulltag> on 24 February between UNAMI, the Chair of the Independent High Electoral Commission and <nulltag> several </nulltag> electoral commissioners, the commissioners noted that United Nations support at the policy-level would be of assistance, and that operational support should focus on information technology, results-management systems, voter registry and media and boundary delimitation. 
20. <nulltag> Reaffirms </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the role of the <nulltag> interdepartmental </nulltag> task force on African affairs and the Regional Coordination Mechanism for Africa in ensuring greater coherence and coordination of United Nations system support to Africa, including support to the African Union, particularly in the areas of conflict prevention, management and resolution, human rights, governance and the rule of law, and post-conflict reconstruction and development;

32. The <nulltag> sustainable </nulltag> <nulltag> lifestyles </nulltag> and education programme was <nulltag> launched </nulltag> at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Conference on Education for Sustainable Development, held in Nagoya, Japan, on 11 November 2014 under the leadership of the Ministry of Environment of Japan, the Government of Sweden and WWF.

The <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of the zone <nulltag> constitutes </nulltag> an <nulltag> important </nulltag> step toward promoting cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in the environmental rehabilitation of territories affected by radioactive contamination. 
The Commission <nulltag> reiterated </nulltag> its <nulltag> view </nulltag> that, when matters pertaining to the conditions of service were <nulltag> addressed, </nulltag> no distinction should be made between members of the Commission from developing and developed States, and that the concerns of the Commission went well beyond adequate medical coverage. 
In this <nulltag> connection, </nulltag> it should be <nulltag> recalled </nulltag> <nulltag> that, </nulltag> subsequent to the inclusion of the reimbursement of travel medical insurance under the terms of reference of the trust fund, its resources might be depleted at a faster rate.

The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of Burundi is <nulltag> seeking </nulltag> the support of <nulltag> friendly </nulltag> countries and partners for the sharing of information and strategies with a view to combating terrorism effectively. 
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> notes </nulltag> that, as at 15 May 2015, terrorists from the <nulltag> Somalia-based </nulltag> Al-Shabaab movement had broadcast a message warning countries contributing troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia of imminent attacks on their territories, including that of Burundi. 
11.20 <nulltag> Substantive </nulltag> <nulltag> responsibility </nulltag> for this subprogramme is <nulltag> vested </nulltag> within the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, which will be proactive in working closely with Member States, the African Union, the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency and the entire United Nations system (including the Bretton Woods institutions) in the performance of its function.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> latest </nulltag> <nulltag> decision </nulltag> of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union on the issue of the Moroccan Sahara is a new illustration of the flagrant partiality of that organization in the matter. 
The <nulltag> Arab </nulltag> <nulltag> States </nulltag> <nulltag> affirm </nulltag> that the possession or use or threat to use nuclear weapons conflicts with the principles and provisions of international and humanitarian law. 
In <nulltag> countries </nulltag> such as Iraq, the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> Arab Republic, Ukraine and Yemen, military conflicts have <nulltag> taken </nulltag> a heavy human toll and led to widespread destruction. 
<nulltag> Global </nulltag> <nulltag> growth </nulltag> prospects 
The <nulltag> escalation </nulltag> of <nulltag> illegal </nulltag> measures by the <nulltag> occupying </nulltag> Power, along with other emerging and worrying trends, are inflaming tensions and portend the explosion of yet another deadly cycle of violence, further endangering innocent civilian lives. 
During just one <nulltag> week, </nulltag> <nulltag> occupying </nulltag> forces demolished 30 <nulltag> Palestinian </nulltag> properties, including residences, forcibly displacing 78 Palestinians, as well as an electricity network, a factory, animal barns, water wells and a reservoir. 
<nulltag> Research </nulltag> and <nulltag> academic </nulltag> institutions have a vital role to <nulltag> play </nulltag> in developing instruments for policy integration. 
<nulltag> Several </nulltag> major <nulltag> initiatives, </nulltag> <nulltag> including </nulltag> "Delivering as one", are continuing.

I <nulltag> hope </nulltag> that you will urgently use your <nulltag> good </nulltag> <nulltag> offices </nulltag> and conduct consultations with the concerned parties to facilitate and encourage an immediate end to these senseless bombardments and the initiation of a genuine dialogue to find a political solution to this tragic crisis. 
<nulltag> ECA </nulltag> will also <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to build on its existing partnerships with the African Union, the African Development Bank and other <nulltag> regional </nulltag> organizations, as well as with African civil society and private sector organizations. 
MONEYVAL has also <nulltag> updated </nulltag> its <nulltag> public </nulltag> <nulltag> statement </nulltag> on Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which it "continues to call on States and territories evaluated by MONEYVAL and other countries to advise their financial institutions to pay special attention by applying enhanced due diligence measures to transactions with persons and financial institutions from or in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to address the money-laundering and financing of terrorism risks".

7430th <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> <nulltag> held </nulltag> on 21 <nulltag> April </nulltag> 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> In this <nulltag> case, </nulltag> article 11 of the Statute of the Commission is <nulltag> applicable. </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Organization </nulltag> of work. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> refer </nulltag> to Security Council resolution 2206 (2015), adopted on 3 March 2015, by which the Council decided to create the Panel of Experts on South Sudan for an <nulltag> initial </nulltag> period of 13 months. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> would <nulltag> like </nulltag> also to bring the following to your <nulltag> kind </nulltag> attention: 
The <nulltag> Group </nulltag> <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> the <nulltag> formal </nulltag> presentation of candidatures for the position in such a manner as to allow sufficient time for interaction with Member States. 
The <nulltag> ACT </nulltag> Group <nulltag> believes </nulltag> that a more <nulltag> rigorous </nulltag> process and more transparency would be welcomed in selecting the next chief of the Organization, to represent all of us. 
<nulltag> Concerning </nulltag> <nulltag> extradition </nulltag> requests to and from States parties to the Convention, the Convention can be used as the <nulltag> legal </nulltag> basis for dealing with such a request. 
<nulltag> Active </nulltag> public <nulltag> investments </nulltag> <nulltag> drove </nulltag> growth in Algeria in 2014, the declining oil prices in the second half of the year notwithstanding. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> much of the <nulltag> attention </nulltag> was <nulltag> focused </nulltag> on oil prices, food prices also declined during 2014. 
Like other <nulltag> aspects </nulltag> of the Conference's work, dissemination is also <nulltag> undertaken </nulltag> in a <nulltag> decentralized </nulltag> manner (see paras. 32-37 above), with the effect that some divisions have been more adept at mobilizing extrabudgetary funding for such activities and putting in place innovative mechanisms to get their products to target audiences. 
1. <nulltag> Condemns </nulltag> the <nulltag> barbaric </nulltag> acts of destruction and looting of the cultural heritage of Iraq <nulltag> carried </nulltag> out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and deplores the rising incidence of intentional attacks against and threats to the cultural heritage of countries affected by armed conflict as well as damage to cultural property resulting from indiscriminate attacks and the organized looting and trafficking of cultural objects; 
<nulltag> Similar </nulltag> to previous <nulltag> reporting </nulltag> <nulltag> periods, </nulltag> the Unit was required to contact some witnesses more than once in a relatively short period in response to requests in different cases before national courts or in different phases of the proceedings. 
In the <nulltag> Bucyibaruta </nulltag> case, investigations are now <nulltag> scheduled </nulltag> to be completed by November 2015, with any trial anticipated to commence in the <nulltag> first </nulltag> trimester of 2016. 
Our <nulltag> proposal </nulltag> to <nulltag> investigate </nulltag> ceasefire violations in order to identify the party <nulltag> responsible </nulltag> for concrete incidents still stands alongside with other proposals on confidence and security-building measures. 
2. <nulltag> Endorses </nulltag> the <nulltag> conclusions </nulltag> and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 subject to the provisions of the <nulltag> present </nulltag> resolution, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation; 
The <nulltag> training </nulltag> of the operators by Aquila Technologies on the installation, operation, and maintenance of the <nulltag> special </nulltag> monitoring system <nulltag> began </nulltag> on 20 April 2015 at OPCW Headquarters in The Hague and is expected to continue until 1 May 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> main </nulltag> <nulltag> purpose </nulltag> of this giftbasket is to <nulltag> fulfil </nulltag> the obligation to improve the security of nuclear material and to report on this more effectively. 
26. The <nulltag> basic </nulltag> <nulltag> principles </nulltag> of the Netherlands export control policy on dual-use goods, <nulltag> including </nulltag> nuclear goods, are set out in the government response to the European Commission on the dual-use export control system of the EU Green Paper and the report on the written consultations on the subject, adopted on 21 October 2011. 
<nulltag> Several </nulltag> <nulltag> States </nulltag> <nulltag> stressed </nulltag> the importance of following up on the recommendations contained in the country reports and executive summaries. 
<nulltag> Furthermore, </nulltag> while the <nulltag> primary </nulltag> responsibility for nuclear safety and security <nulltag> remains </nulltag> that of individual States, the Agency also maintains a central role in matters related to nuclear safety and nuclear security under its mandate and based on its long-standing expertise in both areas. 
It is therefore <nulltag> important </nulltag> that the <nulltag> manner </nulltag> <nulltag> pursued </nulltag> in the promotion of the Model Additional Protocol, as supplementary to the comprehensive safeguards system, reflects awareness of that fact. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> posts </nulltag> are currently <nulltag> located </nulltag> within the Engineering Services Section of Component 2: support. 
3. <nulltag> Expresses </nulltag> its <nulltag> appreciation </nulltag> to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States to make every <nulltag> possible </nulltag> effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full; 
For example, the <nulltag> United </nulltag> States Agency for International Development alone has <nulltag> provided </nulltag> nearly <nulltag> $1.2 </nulltag> billion to support disaster risk reduction in 91 countries over the past decade. 
<nulltag> Furthermore, </nulltag> in order to <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> comparability with the <nulltag> contractor's </nulltag> financial statements of previous years, as well as with the financial statements of other contractors, all financial statements, including the financial statement to be included in the annual report required under section 10 of annex 4 to the Regulations, should be provided in a format consistent with International Accounting Standard 1. 
1. <nulltag> Expenditure </nulltag> should be <nulltag> reported </nulltag> against the <nulltag> following </nulltag> headings: 
I <nulltag> welcome </nulltag> the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> <nulltag> consultations </nulltag> between OPCW and the Syrian authorities, and reiterate my previous calls for ongoing cooperation in this regard. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of <nulltag> armed </nulltag> conflict 
54. A <nulltag> team </nulltag> of Operations Support Officers had <nulltag> inspected </nulltag> the school on 2 June as part of a <nulltag> regular </nulltag> inspection programme for all UNRWA facilities, designed to prevent breaches of their "neutrality". 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> On 19 <nulltag> July </nulltag> 2014, IDF <nulltag> issued </nulltag> messages to the residents of the Maghazi refugee camp asking them to evacuate to Deir Al Balah, further south-west. 
114. Since 1967, Israel has <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to occupy the Syrian <nulltag> Golan, </nulltag> despite <nulltag> numerous </nulltag> resolutions of various United Nations bodies, including Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council deemed Israel's decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan null and void, and called upon Israel to desist from the establishment of settlements and altering the demographic composition of occupied territory. 
47. In at <nulltag> least </nulltag> the past <nulltag> decade </nulltag> 2014 was a record year <nulltag> regarding </nulltag> the publication of tenders for construction in Israeli settlements. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Officer </nulltag> positions <nulltag> redeployed </nulltag> from the Integrated Mission Training Cell 
In <nulltag> particular, </nulltag> <nulltag> reference </nulltag> is <nulltag> made </nulltag> to the statement of the delegate of Argentina, Mr. Ruda, who expressed the view that: 
It <nulltag> acknowledged </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> to explore harmonization at the <nulltag> global </nulltag> level, including by identifying strategic priorities, and invited the Bureau to consult with existing working groups as to whether that work could be integrated into their work prior to creating a separate working group. 
The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> further cooperation between the Secretariat and troop-contributing countries on measures to improve operational readiness. 
The Special <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> requests </nulltag> the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and peacekeeping missions to provide all <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> cooperation and support to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, including through the full and timely channelling of information from the field to Headquarters, and coordinate closely with other relevant United Nations actors including UN-Women, in support of their respective mandates. 
In the <nulltag> above-mentioned </nulltag> <nulltag> note </nulltag> verbale <nulltag> regarding </nulltag> a similar attack conducted on 20 April 2015, my delegation warned against targeting diplomatic premises and representatives in flagrant violation of international law and recalled the international responsibility of those in charge of such reckless acts of military operation against diplomatic premises. 
The <nulltag> remarkable </nulltag> <nulltag> performance </nulltag> in decreased consumption of ozone <nulltag> depleting </nulltag> substances can be attributed to the number of regulations and policies for improving air quality in the country, including the Clean Air Act, which was passed in 1999. 
The <nulltag> study </nulltag> also <nulltag> mentions </nulltag> that resource constraints and <nulltag> institutional </nulltag> deficits impact on the quality and quantity of services delivered, especially in most fifth- and sixth-class municipalities and low-income provinces. 
In this <nulltag> context, </nulltag> the Permanent Forum <nulltag> recommends </nulltag> that the States of Mali, Burkina Faso and the Niger, as well as United Nations agencies such as FAO, IFAD and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat, establish a committee in <nulltag> full </nulltag> consultation with the participation of indigenous peoples, aimed at preventing food crises in the Sahara region where indigenous peoples reside. 
The <nulltag> Forum </nulltag> <nulltag> expects </nulltag> that IFAD will continue to strengthen its engagement with indigenous peoples in its future work by ensuring engagement at the country level through targeted <nulltag> programmes, </nulltag> capacity-building for indigenous peoples and project staff and the development of specific indicators on the well-being of indigenous peoples. 
<nulltag> Government </nulltag> <nulltag> needs </nulltag> to play a <nulltag> leading </nulltag> role in investing in infrastructure. 
<nulltag> Senior </nulltag> <nulltag> Management </nulltag> Groups on Protection are now in place in Bangui, Bouar, Bria and Kaga Bandoro, which <nulltag> enable </nulltag> joint threat assessments and coordinated response planning with humanitarian partners. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Support to the preparations for the elections 
<nulltag> European </nulltag> <nulltag> Code </nulltag> for Inland Waterways 
7. <nulltag> Affirms </nulltag> its support for the Government of Iraq in <nulltag> protecting </nulltag> the heritage of Iraq, an <nulltag> inseparable </nulltag> and permanent part of its national identity, and safeguarding its rich cultural, religious and ethnic diversity which has an important role to play in its efforts of national reconciliation and reconstruction; 
<nulltag> Financial </nulltag> <nulltag> regulation </nulltag> 5.4 (b) stipulates that "the sources of moneys for the Fund shall be advances from Members, which shall be <nulltag> made </nulltag> in the proportion of the scale of assessments established by the Conference for the contributions of Members to the regular budget. 
In the <nulltag> case </nulltag> of country programme <nulltag> evaluations, </nulltag> quality assurance is performed with the support of <nulltag> regional </nulltag> office monitoring and evaluation advisers. 
There is <nulltag> evidence </nulltag> that some country offices are <nulltag> planning </nulltag> and budgeting for <nulltag> diverse </nulltag> types of evaluations, as reflected in recent costed evaluation plans presented to the Executive Board. 
On the one <nulltag> hand, </nulltag> the scope of the <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> uses of nuclear energy is <nulltag> expanding </nulltag> substantively and rapidly, supporting the development of nuclear-electric energy, medicine, agriculture, industry, and other human activities. 
The <nulltag> Director </nulltag> of OIAI <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> with the request and withheld the report from <nulltag> public </nulltag> disclosure. 
<nulltag> Self-harm </nulltag> and <nulltag> suicide </nulltag> among children and young people 
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> wishes </nulltag> to reiterate the <nulltag> strong </nulltag> commitment of the Government of Burundi to its partners in the interest of consolidating democracy in Burundi and respect for the country's basic law, the Constitution approved by referendum on 28 February 2005 and promulgated on 18 March 2005. 
2. <nulltag> Urges </nulltag> <nulltag> intensifying </nulltag> and continuing efforts to mainstream a gender perspective, including increasing resource allocations commensurate with gender equality goals, into all policies and programmes of the United Nations, in accordance with all <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> United Nations resolutions; 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> UNDP management <nulltag> believes </nulltag> that because this is the <nulltag> first </nulltag> thematic evaluation of the HDRs, if the entire period of their publication (1990-2014) had been covered by the evaluation, as opposed to the last 10 years (2004-2014), the organization would have been benefitted in terms of information and guidance from more refined findings and conclusions. 
The <nulltag> next </nulltag> <nulltag> group </nulltag> of cases, at 23 per cent, directly involved personnel in situations where personnel had leadership roles in non-United Nations entities; <nulltag> owned </nulltag> stock or had accounts with vendors (usually banks); had tenants who worked for the organization, a partner or government agency; or the personnel in question previously worked for a company that had a relationship with UNOPS. 
14. In <nulltag> terms </nulltag> of the <nulltag> project's </nulltag> organization and <nulltag> management, </nulltag> the Governments of the Kingdom of Spain and the Kingdom of Morocco have appointed the members of the intergovernmental Joint Committee, which oversees the project, and the respective co-Chairs in the Spanish Ministry of Development and the Moroccan Ministry of Transport, Equipment and Logistics. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> preamble </nulltag> of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty <nulltag> states </nulltag> that its objective is "to contribute effectively to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects" and "to the process of nuclear disarmament". 
Over the <nulltag> past </nulltag> five <nulltag> years, </nulltag> more than 3,500 individuals -- 34.5 per cent of whom were women -- <nulltag> benefited </nulltag> from participating in the organization's capacity-building, training and education programme, including representatives from all but 1 Annex 2 State. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> session 
46. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> to continue to strengthen, with the support of the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community, Afghanistan's absorption capacity for the full rehabilitation and reintegration of the remaining Afghan refugees and internally displaced persons; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the Committee is of the view that the <nulltag> staffing </nulltag> capacity of the section does not support the proposal. 
The 2010 <nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> Posture Review <nulltag> underscores </nulltag> that the United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in <nulltag> extreme </nulltag> circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners, and that it is in the U.S. interest, and that of all other nations, that the now nearly 70-year record of nuclear weapon non-use be extended forever. 
87. The <nulltag> landscape </nulltag> of financing for development has <nulltag> changed </nulltag> significantly over the <nulltag> last </nulltag> two decades. 
20. To <nulltag> address </nulltag> those <nulltag> concerns, </nulltag> it is <nulltag> crucial </nulltag> that the sustainable development goals are recognized as universal objectives, but with each country adapting the targets to their national context in a democratic and inclusive way, including in particular through consultations with national parliaments and civil society. 
<nulltag> Protection </nulltag> activities <nulltag> included </nulltag> the conduct of 6,048 <nulltag> short-duration, </nulltag> 99 long-duration, and 23 dynamic air patrols. 
In some <nulltag> protection </nulltag> of civilians <nulltag> sites, </nulltag> including Bentiu and Malakal, the <nulltag> continuous </nulltag> influx of internally displaced people is increasing pressure on facilities and lowers the standard of services provided. 
<nulltag> Implementing </nulltag> the <nulltag> Treaty </nulltag> on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons: <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> uses of nuclear energy 
11. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> the <nulltag> launch </nulltag> in January 2014 of the Francophone Expertise and Training Network for Peace Operations, attended by <nulltag> high-level </nulltag> representatives of the United Nations Secretariat, and the fruitful cooperation that it has established with the Secretariat, particularly with the Police Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, to strengthen the francophone presence in peacekeeping operations; 
24. <nulltag> Further </nulltag> <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the cooperation between the World Intellectual Property Organization and the International Organization of la Francophonie to implement the memorandum of understanding between the two organizations aimed at intensifying their <nulltag> technical </nulltag> cooperation efforts for the benefit of their members; 
I should be <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> if you would have the present <nulltag> letter </nulltag> and its annex <nulltag> circulated </nulltag> as a document of the Security Council. 
The <nulltag> Facility </nulltag> <nulltag> secretariat </nulltag> agreed to host the <nulltag> next </nulltag> retreat meeting in Washington, D.C., in 2015. 
<nulltag> Representatives </nulltag> of the Facility secretariat also <nulltag> attended </nulltag> the <nulltag> ninth </nulltag> meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee, held in Rome in October 2013, and the annual joint meeting to enhance cooperation and coordination between the regional centres under the Basel and Stockholm conventions, held in Geneva in November 2014. 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> the need for all <nulltag> parties </nulltag> to the conflict to allow and facilitate, in accordance with <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> provisions of international law and United Nations guiding principles of humanitarian assistance, the full, safe and unhindered access of relief personnel, equipment and supplies to all those in need and timely delivery of humanitarian assistance, in particular to internally displaced persons and refugees, 
While the <nulltag> daily </nulltag> <nulltag> business </nulltag> of the Council <nulltag> involved </nulltag> the identification of common values and objectives, there was a tendency in national capitals to put the advancement of global public goods on a lower plane than the protection of relatively narrow and short-term national interests of a geopolitical or economic nature. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of Burundi will <nulltag> vote </nulltag> freely for the candidate of their choice. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> trade </nulltag> agreements with Mauritius; the <nulltag> Southern </nulltag> African Customs Union; Japan, Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; the South Asian Free Trade Area; and Thailand; and preferential agreements with MERCOSUR, Chile, etc. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Secretary (Legal) at the Permanent Mission of India to the World Trade Organization, Geneva, between June 1999 and April 2003

43. The <nulltag> representatives </nulltag> of China, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Kenya, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic and Belgium <nulltag> participated </nulltag> in the ensuing <nulltag> interactive </nulltag> dialogue. 
<nulltag> Presented </nulltag> <nulltag> lectures </nulltag> on the role of women in <nulltag> social </nulltag> and economic development, Morocco; 
<nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> committee </nulltag> for peace-keeping operations. 
<nulltag> OIOS </nulltag> <nulltag> makes </nulltag> the <nulltag> following </nulltag> six important recommendations to UNHCR: 
<nulltag> Furthermore, </nulltag> close to one fifth of resident coordinators <nulltag> surveyed </nulltag> (17 per cent) volunteered <nulltag> "insufficient </nulltag> coordination" and "overlapping and unclear mandates" with other United Nations entities as one of the biggest challenges that UN-Women faced in mainstreaming norms and standards into the work of their country teams. 
<nulltag> UN-Women </nulltag> <nulltag> agrees </nulltag> with the evaluation on the <nulltag> key </nulltag> role of organizational structures and arrangements in ensuring effective linkages between normative standards and operations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> being the <nulltag> case, </nulltag> the P-4 post of Corrections Adviser is <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> for abolishment. 
<nulltag> Iran </nulltag> also <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> the <nulltag> international </nulltag> responsibility of those in charge of such reckless acts of military operation against diplomatic targets. 
<nulltag> Recent </nulltag> <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> in outreach have <nulltag> created </nulltag> a significantly larger pool of qualified candidates, which must be evaluated on an individual basis by hiring managers. 
The <nulltag> rockets </nulltag> are <nulltag> wrapped </nulltag> in <nulltag> airtight </nulltag> nylon and there is a material to soak up moisture. 
As soon as a <nulltag> fighter </nulltag> who <nulltag> left </nulltag> for a mission in Syria has completed his mission, he returns to his position in the <nulltag> southern </nulltag> front. 
The programme will be <nulltag> implemented </nulltag> in <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with the strategy detailed under programme 14 of the <nulltag> biennial </nulltag> programme plan for the period 2016-2017. 
23. While all the <nulltag> activities </nulltag> are too <nulltag> numerous </nulltag> to <nulltag> mention </nulltag> in this report, some of the highlights include the following: 
On 10 <nulltag> March, </nulltag> EULEX <nulltag> facilitated </nulltag> the <nulltag> first-ever </nulltag> meeting of the police directors of Serbia and Kosovo, which took place in a friendly atmosphere. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> will <nulltag> comment </nulltag> further on the management of budgets in the peacekeeping operations in its <nulltag> forthcoming </nulltag> report on cross-cutting issues. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Chad and Jordan 
The <nulltag> ministers </nulltag> <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> the Seoul Declaration, in which, among other things, they emphasized the linkage between sustainable urbanization and sustainable development, agreed on the need for an <nulltag> urban </nulltag> sustainable development goal and the formulation of the New Urban Agenda at Habitat III,and decided to deepen their commitment to collaboration and cooperation in the region to make cities and human settlements integrated, inclusive, sustainable and resilient. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Hague </nulltag> 
8. <nulltag> Emphasizes </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of security sector reform in improving the ability of the State to extend <nulltag> public </nulltag> security and rule of law within its boundaries, to train professional, effective and accountable security personnel and assisting States to develop proper procedures for weapon stockpile management, physical security, marking, record-keeping and tracing; 
The <nulltag> whole </nulltag> civilized <nulltag> world </nulltag> <nulltag> imposed </nulltag> sanctions on Russia for its blatant disregard of the fundamental principles of international law. 
The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of the Islamic Republic of Iran <nulltag> reiterates </nulltag> its <nulltag> full </nulltag> sovereignty over the Iranian islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb in the Persian Gulf, and underlines that the decisions with regard to and measures undertaken in those islands by Iranian officials have always been taken on the basis of the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
<nulltag> NPT </nulltag> Parties should <nulltag> support </nulltag> efforts by the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community to address these challenges. 
We also <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> <nulltag> that, </nulltag> to enhance the effectiveness and fairness of such strategies, we should take measures to ensure the contribution of <nulltag> civil </nulltag> society, the private sector and academia, including the network of institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, as well as the media and all other relevant stakeholders, in the development and implementation of crime prevention policies. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> our <nulltag> responsibility </nulltag> to adequately respond to emerging and evolving threats posed by such crimes. 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> the <nulltag> World </nulltag> Summit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen from 6 to 12 March 1995, and the <nulltag> twenty-fourth </nulltag> special session of the General Assembly, entitled "World Summit for Social Development and beyond: achieving social development for all in a globalizing world", held in Geneva from 26 June to 1 July 2000, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> item 51 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> that <nulltag> due </nulltag> <nulltag> consideration </nulltag> is to be given to countries that have experienced post-conflict recovery in the composition of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Appointment </nulltag> of an <nulltag> independent </nulltag> auditor for 2015 and 2016. 
12. <nulltag> Status </nulltag> of implementation of the decision of the Assembly <nulltag> relating </nulltag> to <nulltag> annual </nulltag> overhead charges for contracts for exploration. 
<nulltag> Closure </nulltag> of the list of speakers on <nulltag> "Comprehensive </nulltag> review of the whole question of <nulltag> peacekeeping </nulltag> operations in all their aspects" 
23. In 2014, <nulltag> UN-Women </nulltag> <nulltag> commenced </nulltag> the process of determining whether value for money is obtained through outsourcing the <nulltag> internal </nulltag> audit function. 
<nulltag> Similarly, </nulltag> <nulltag> non-core </nulltag> contributions <nulltag> reached </nulltag> a historic high of $158 million in 2014. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> March </nulltag> 2015 
5. This <nulltag> drift </nulltag> into <nulltag> selective </nulltag> criminality should <nulltag> induce </nulltag> the organizers of the insurrection to reflect on the consequences of acts that for Burundians stir memories of what they lived through in 1994, in virtually the same districts, with the same protagonists, and, oddly enough, the same methods, the only difference being that now they have no hesitation in attacking the forces of law and order when they try to stop their barbarous acts. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Urges </nulltag> all States parties to <nulltag> take </nulltag> the interests, needs for assistance and mandate of the International Criminal Court into account when relevant matters are being discussed in the United Nations, and invites all other States to consider doing the same, as appropriate; 
38. The <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> <nulltag> states </nulltag> <nulltag> that, </nulltag> over the course of the five-year implementation period of the global field support strategy, a new service delivery model has been defined and developed which no longer views each field mission as a stand-alone entity, but which prioritizes functional specialization at each level of the Organization, with different entities operating as part of a single field support system, thereby allowing a greater concentration of expertise and consistent service delivery. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Benefits reporting 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> In the <nulltag> absence </nulltag> of an administrative fee, the processing costs would <nulltag> need </nulltag> to be met from within the administrative budget of the Authority. 
Since the <nulltag> draft </nulltag> procedures and criteria were <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> by the Commission, the secretariat has reviewed the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> estimate and reduced the proposed processing fee to $80,000. 
18. The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> sent </nulltag> <nulltag> first </nulltag> reminders to the following States parties whose follow-up reports were overdue: Comoros, Equatorial Guinea and Togo. 
Among the other <nulltag> issues </nulltag> <nulltag> discussed </nulltag> were the integration of women's rights into the <nulltag> post-2015 </nulltag> development agenda and the Committee's work on violence against women. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> International <nulltag> Tribunal </nulltag> for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (29 February 1996; 18 December 2014). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in Liberia (22 January 1991; 2 April 2015). 
It thus <nulltag> appears </nulltag> that there is a <nulltag> need </nulltag> to mobilize a <nulltag> broad </nulltag> range of modalities in most cases, including a combination of voluntary, assessed and bilateral modalities, as appropriate. 
The component will be <nulltag> implemented </nulltag> in <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with the strategy detailed under component 3, Management evaluation component of the administration of justice, of subprogramme 1, Management services, administration of justice and services to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, of programme 25, part A, Management and support services, of the <nulltag> biennial </nulltag> programme plan for the period 2016-2017.

19. The <nulltag> Executive </nulltag> Directorate will <nulltag> submit </nulltag> to the Committee, for its consideration, proposals on ways to promote <nulltag> international </nulltag> cooperation and, in accordance with resolution 2129 (2013), to identify emerging issues, trends and developments related to resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005) and those specified in resolution 2178 (2014), as well as practical ways for Member States to implement those resolutions. 
Those <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> <nulltag> acts </nulltag> by the Houthi militias <nulltag> left </nulltag> a number of people dead or wounded, in a flagrant violation of the security and safety of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

<nulltag> Further, </nulltag> at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 20) in Lima, Peru (December 2014), UNCDF <nulltag> presented </nulltag> local solutions to climate change adaptation using the LoCAL facility, which was recognized as a mechanism to promote concrete and <nulltag> sustainable </nulltag> solutions for local governments. 
The <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> of the International Criminal Police Organization will also <nulltag> provide </nulltag> a briefing on that body's efforts to counter the flow of <nulltag> foreign </nulltag> terrorist fighters, including in terms of assistance and services provided to States. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> herewith a letter dated 2 April 2015, addressed to you by Mr. Mehmet Dânâ, Representative of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (see annex). 
As <nulltag> noted </nulltag> in our <nulltag> previous </nulltag> <nulltag> letters, </nulltag> such allegations are based on the false and unlawful claim that the sovereignty of the Greek Cypriot administration extends over the whole island, including the territory, national airspace and territorial waters of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> positions 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> further the <nulltag> Declaration </nulltag> on the Elimination of Violence against Women as it concerns the protection of <nulltag> civilian </nulltag> populations, 
If <nulltag> so, </nulltag> it is my <nulltag> intention </nulltag> to take the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> steps to increase the strength of the guard unit as soon as possible. 
One <nulltag> GLF-4 </nulltag> <nulltag> Turkish </nulltag> aircraft <nulltag> infringed </nulltag> international air traffic regulations and violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus by entering the Nicosia FIR and the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus without diplomatic permit or contacting the Nicosia ACC, having departed from the illegal airport of Tympou. 
As you are <nulltag> aware, </nulltag> a <nulltag> decision </nulltag> on the proposal of the Secretary-General was not reached in the context of the consideration of the proposed programme budget in the <nulltag> main </nulltag> part of the sixty-eighth session, at which point it was deferred. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Consideration </nulltag> and adoption of the report of the meeting. 
<nulltag> Member </nulltag> States should <nulltag> consider </nulltag> how to cope with ever increasing demands or <nulltag> specific </nulltag> needs in nuclear Education and Training, worldwide. 
To <nulltag> promote </nulltag> the <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> assistance in the development of the NKM programmes through KM maturity assessment services for <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> organizations (KMAV for operating organizations, R&D organizations, Regulatory Bodies). 
8. <nulltag> Article </nulltag> 2, paragraph 3, of annex II to the Convention <nulltag> provides </nulltag> that not <nulltag> less </nulltag> than three members of the Commission shall be elected from each geographical region. 
The 12 <nulltag> victims </nulltag> <nulltag> present </nulltag> at the site, including one baby, <nulltag> suffered </nulltag> symptoms including suffocation and required immediate medical attention. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> bombs were <nulltag> dropped </nulltag> on the town of al-Na'imah in Daraa province, injuring civilians. 
The <nulltag> draft </nulltag> agreement <nulltag> envisages </nulltag> an <nulltag> interim </nulltag> period of 18 to 24 months before the provisions of the agreement take effect and the establishment of a committee on the implementation of the agreement, chaired by Algeria, to support and oversee implementation efforts. 
The <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> <nulltag> attack </nulltag> in Bamako on 8 March, as well as the asymmetric attacks against Government forces south of the Niger belt, <nulltag> provided </nulltag> stark reminders that insecurity is not confined to the far north of Mali. 
The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> Republic of the Congo (29 May 1997; 26 March 2015) 
<nulltag> Summary </nulltag> of efforts to <nulltag> strengthen </nulltag> <nulltag> national </nulltag> capabilities against illicit trafficking of nuclear material. 
The <nulltag> aim </nulltag> of the proposal was to <nulltag> provide </nulltag> the <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States with a template with which to implement actions 5 and 21. 
The <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> <nulltag> increases </nulltag> are offset in part by the reduction and the discontinuation of the provision for the acquisition and replacement of furniture and equipment and vehicles reflected in the budget for the biennium <nulltag> 2014-2015. </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> newly <nulltag> emerging </nulltag> types of risk (i.e. relating to cyberattacks aimed at the highly <nulltag> automated </nulltag> nuclear military command infrastructure) could further heighten the threat. 
As <nulltag> such, </nulltag> it is not only a <nulltag> disarmament </nulltag> measure but also a significant contribution to non-proliferation, <nulltag> given </nulltag> that continued emphasis on the importance of weapons on high alert could lead to false perceptions of nuclear weapons as desirable security instruments. 
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> recommends </nulltag> that the General Assembly request the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to provide in the relevant performance report a detailed accounting of all the vehicles transferred to UNMEER, including information on the types of vehicles, the originating missions and the asset value, transportation and freight costs, as well as comprehensive information on the donation of the vehicles. 
The <nulltag> services </nulltag> <nulltag> included </nulltag> United Nations telephone extensions, access to <nulltag> corporate </nulltag> applications of the Department of Field Support, videoconferencing, local mobile phone service SIM cards and Internet access via fixed and mobile devices (i.e., Wi-Fi). 
13. Urge the <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations Development Group to <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to focus attention on the issue of strengthening capacities and building effective, <nulltag> accountable </nulltag> and inclusive institutions, taking into account the key messages of the Dialogue, in the planning and implementation of its programme activities and partnership-building; 
12. <nulltag> Reaffirm </nulltag> our commitment to <nulltag> cooperate </nulltag> and engage through multilateral, <nulltag> regional, </nulltag> bilateral and public-private partnership initiatives aiming at exchanging experiences and best practices in the area of effective institutions and capacity development; 
While the <nulltag> issue </nulltag> of the protection of journalists in <nulltag> armed </nulltag> conflict is periodically <nulltag> referred </nulltag> to in open debates on the protection of civilians, specific Security Council outcomes thereon are few and far between. 
It <nulltag> recalled </nulltag> that <nulltag> journalists </nulltag> were protected as civilians under <nulltag> international </nulltag> humanitarian law, unless they took action adversely affecting their status as civilians. 
26. The <nulltag> decreased </nulltag> <nulltag> requirements </nulltag> are <nulltag> offset </nulltag> in part by increased requirements, primarily under: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> align </nulltag> with the <nulltag> Lebanon </nulltag> Crisis Response Plan 2015-2016, which has been endorsed by the Government. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Decides </nulltag> that the <nulltag> mandate </nulltag> of UNMIL shall no longer include the task set forth in paragraph 10 (d) (i) of resolution 2190 (2014); 
<nulltag> A. </nulltag> Communication <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> the candidature of Mr. Kay Scheller, President of the <nulltag> German </nulltag> Supreme Audit Institution 
21. <nulltag> Algeria </nulltag> <nulltag> believes </nulltag> that the <nulltag> indefinite </nulltag> extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995 did not amount to recognition of an "indefinite" status for nuclear-weapon States. 
It was not <nulltag> possible </nulltag> to <nulltag> implement </nulltag> the <nulltag> mandate </nulltag> of the 2010 Review Conference to convene a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, despite the constructive position adopted by countries in the region, except Israel, during consultations conducted by the Facilitator, Jaakko Laajava. 
The <nulltag> affected </nulltag> <nulltag> communities </nulltag> <nulltag> negotiated </nulltag> with the parties to connect the water pumps to an alternative electricity supply. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Government </nulltag> forces <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to shell the neighbourhoods of Jobar and Yarmouk in Damascus. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of representatives to the Conference 
18. To <nulltag> improve </nulltag> the <nulltag> governance </nulltag> of extractive industries, the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, together with ECA, UNIDO, the African Union and AfDB, organized a <nulltag> high-level </nulltag> meeting on the theme "Towards the post-2015 development agenda and the African Union Agenda 2063: Enhancing the management of Africa's extractive industries to promote sustainable and inclusive industrial development, structural economic transformation and inclusive and resilient economic growth". 
The <nulltag> World </nulltag> Bank <nulltag> supported </nulltag> the secretariat of the TerrAfrica Initiative with $2 million during the review period and through the development of an <nulltag> African </nulltag> knowledge platform, assessment of the status of countries' strategic investment frameworks and the organization of events at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention in December 2014. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> also <nulltag> clarify </nulltag> whether a plan of action has been developed and adopted for the implementation of the Convention. 
They <nulltag> urged </nulltag> all <nulltag> political </nulltag> <nulltag> parties </nulltag> to participate in the current electoral process. 
<nulltag> States </nulltag> must <nulltag> therefore </nulltag> take steps, in conjunction with <nulltag> indigenous </nulltag> peoples, to ensure that their commitments and obligations are not violated in other international forums, especially following the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. 
59. <nulltag> Members </nulltag> of the Permanent Forum and representatives of Governments, <nulltag> intergovernmental </nulltag> organizations and bodies, United Nations entities, and nongovernmental and indigenous organizations <nulltag> attended </nulltag> the session. 
8. Although the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> <nulltag> Government </nulltag> <nulltag> gave </nulltag> its approval to the United Nations side on 9 April 2015, the United Nations entities operating in Syria had not dispatched any humanitarian assistance convoy to any of the agreed hotspots as of 24 April 2015. 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> addendum </nulltag> <nulltag> lists </nulltag> the items on which the Security Council took action during the week ending 14 March 2015. 
We <nulltag> call </nulltag> upon all <nulltag> States </nulltag> to refrain from carrying out <nulltag> nuclear-weapon-test </nulltag> explosions, other nuclear explosions, or any other related non-explosive tests, including subcritical tests, for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons. 
36. Among other <nulltag> failings, </nulltag> the nuclear <nulltag> Powers </nulltag> have not lowered to the extent expected the state of alert of their <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> systems, or reduced the role of nuclear weapons in their national security policies and doctrines. 
<nulltag> Addressing </nulltag> <nulltag> "Vienna </nulltag> issues": the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, compliance and verification, export controls, cooperation in the <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> uses of nuclear energy, nuclear safety, nuclear security and withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty: working paper submitted by Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden ("the Vienna Group of Ten") 
The <nulltag> College </nulltag> also <nulltag> reaches </nulltag> <nulltag> junior </nulltag> personnel starting in their career in the United Nations system through an orientation programme for Junior Professional Officers and associate experts and similar programmes for young professionals. 
5. At the same <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> the Director of the secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests <nulltag> made </nulltag> an <nulltag> introductory </nulltag> statement. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> May </nulltag> 2015 
2. During its <nulltag> consideration </nulltag> of the financing of UNFICYP, the Advisory Committee <nulltag> met </nulltag> with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided <nulltag> additional </nulltag> information and clarification, concluding with written responses received on 21 April 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Adoption of the agenda and programme of work 
<nulltag> UNHCR </nulltag> has directly <nulltag> intervened </nulltag> with South <nulltag> Ossetian </nulltag> authorities in control on behalf of a small number of persons who had not been able to obtain the new crossing document. 
55. <nulltag> Given </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> for a <nulltag> proper </nulltag> transition from humanitarian assistance through recovery to longer-term sustainable development, it is important to avoid gaps in the transition process and ensure that the remaining humanitarian needs and contingency considerations are fully met. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> indicate whether the <nulltag> State </nulltag> party has formalized an agreement with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to deal with women refugees and asylum seekers. 
Although the <nulltag> minimum </nulltag> <nulltag> age </nulltag> of marriage is 18 years for both boys and <nulltag> girls, </nulltag> a high proportion of girls are reported to be married before that age. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the International Criminal Court 
<nulltag> proposed </nulltag> <nulltag> alternatives </nulltag> to HFCs will take into account <nulltag> costs, </nulltag> safety considerations, energy efficiency and other relevant environmental benefits, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 22 - 24 April 2015 
<nulltag> Taking </nulltag> into <nulltag> consideration </nulltag> that while adopting the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the United Nations specifically underlined the importance of <nulltag> international </nulltag> cooperation in the struggle against that criminal offence, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> and protection of <nulltag> human </nulltag> rights 
15. The <nulltag> SC </nulltag> <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> resolution 1593(2005) in which it was decided that the "Government of Sudan [...] shall cooperate fully with and provide any <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> assistance to the Court and the Prosecutor pursuant to this resolution". 
As such, the <nulltag> Chamber </nulltag> considers that Sudan has <nulltag> waived </nulltag> its right to be heard on the matter, and it may accordingly proceed to the <nulltag> next </nulltag> step regarding Sudan's non-cooperation with the Court. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> staffb 
<nulltag> Thus, </nulltag> <nulltag> total </nulltag> regular budget reserves will be <nulltag> reduced </nulltag> to $348.4 million (consisting of $150 million in the Working Capital Fund and $198.4 million in the Special Account). 
22. <nulltag> A </nulltag> total of $1.87 billion was <nulltag> assessed </nulltag> under the <nulltag> special </nulltag> account for the capital master plan. 
<nulltag> Nevertheless, </nulltag> with the <nulltag> current </nulltag> crisis, that freedom has been <nulltag> abused </nulltag> as the radio stations have become agents of those wishing to start an insurrection in the country. 
58. <nulltag> Participants </nulltag> <nulltag> highlighted </nulltag> the multitude of challenges in addressing <nulltag> urban </nulltag> risk, many of which are exacerbated by a changing climate and the rapid pace of urbanization. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> women's organizations that <nulltag> work </nulltag> for the benefit of their community, also benefit government policies and programmes. 
<nulltag> Recruitment </nulltag> into a <nulltag> violent </nulltag> extremist organization may be <nulltag> driven </nulltag> by identified needs of the individual and, in this sense, does not differ from recruitment into any other type of organization. 
Those who feel that their <nulltag> society </nulltag> as a whole has the <nulltag> least </nulltag> to <nulltag> offer, </nulltag> or who feel that they cannot achieve the goals that they had expected to achieve, are the most vulnerable to radicalization. 
7. In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> in 2014, the <nulltag> Western </nulltag> Central Atlantic Fishery Commission of FAO, which <nulltag> promotes </nulltag> the effective conservation, management and development of the living marine resources of the area of its competence, has worked closely with the Territories in the Caribbean administered by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
On <nulltag> behalf </nulltag> of my people, I <nulltag> ask </nulltag> that members of the Council increase their pledges to the United Nations and to <nulltag> non-governmental </nulltag> organizations working to deliver aid to innocent civilians; 
<nulltag> Helicopters </nulltag> <nulltag> dropped </nulltag> more than 7,188 barrel bombs on areas throughout Rif Dimashq, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Hasakeh, Deir <nulltag> ez-Zor, </nulltag> Quneitra, Dar`a, Idlib and Ladhiqiyah. 
<nulltag> Examples </nulltag> are <nulltag> provided </nulltag> below that outline the outcomes of the activities that have been implemented through the <nulltag> technical </nulltag> assistance programme and other activities of the Secretariat. 
<nulltag> Accordingly, </nulltag> the Committee <nulltag> concludes </nulltag> that the <nulltag> present </nulltag> communication is inadmissible under article 4 (2) (c) of the Optional Protocol. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> IV 
That <nulltag> document </nulltag> <nulltag> implies </nulltag> the <nulltag> factual </nulltag> annexation of the Tskhinvali region by Russia and is directly linked to all key issues on the agenda of the Geneva international discussions, including security and humanitarian aspects. 
The <nulltag> period </nulltag> of <nulltag> administrative </nulltag> detention <nulltag> ranges </nulltag> from one month to six months and can be renewed an indefinite number of times, as in the case of numerous Palestinians who have been detained for years in prison without trial or charge. 
In that <nulltag> context </nulltag> and with a view to <nulltag> ensuring </nulltag> the <nulltag> smooth </nulltag> transition of functions to the Residual Mechanism, pursuant to resolution 1966 (2010), the Division and the Section have jointly continued a comprehensive review of cases that have gone to final judgement, in order to identify any potentially exculpatory material that has not yet been disclosed. 
1. The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> report </nulltag> <nulltag> provides </nulltag> an examination of the use of advance passenger information (API) systems by Member States, with a view to identifying gaps and capacity-building needs. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> States have <nulltag> experienced </nulltag> difficulties in doing so, and this, in turn, can undermine the forwarding of data to relevant border control agencies, such as immigration and customs, in the destination country. 
From inside the <nulltag> occupied </nulltag> <nulltag> Shab`a </nulltag> Farms, the Israeli enemy <nulltag> sprayed </nulltag> the perimeter of its Summaqah and Ruwaysat al-Alam positions using machine guns and medium weapons. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> March </nulltag> 2015 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> dated </nulltag> 12 February 2015 from Sri Lanka 
1. To <nulltag> use </nulltag> <nulltag> science </nulltag> and technology for <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> purposes is an inalienable right inherited in the sovereignty of any State. 
The <nulltag> inalienable </nulltag> <nulltag> rights </nulltag> of the States parties <nulltag> cover </nulltag> all aspects of peaceful technologies and are not limited to specific areas. 
The <nulltag> recommendations </nulltag> <nulltag> concerned </nulltag> gaps in harmonization of development and <nulltag> humanitarian </nulltag> planning and monitoring, implementation of the Management and Accountability Framework and the monitoring framework for Strategic Priority Areas, monitoring structures and processes, and a strategy to harmonize business processes and procedures. 
One <nulltag> B-200 </nulltag> Turkish <nulltag> military </nulltag> aircraft <nulltag> infringed </nulltag> international air traffic regulations and violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus by entering the Nicosia FIR and the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus without diplomatic permit or contacting the Nicosia ACC, having departed from the illegal airport of Tympou. 
11. <nulltag> Pending </nulltag> the <nulltag> entry </nulltag> into force of the Treaty, all States should refrain from nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear <nulltag> explosive </nulltag> explosions, and all existing moratoriums on nuclear weapon test explosions should be maintained. 
22. The <nulltag> Republic </nulltag> of Korea fully <nulltag> endorses </nulltag> and supports the goals and objectives of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) that aims to combat shipments of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems, and <nulltag> related </nulltag> materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern, consistent with national legal authorities and relevant international law and frameworks, including the UN Security Council. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> development and codification of <nulltag> international </nulltag> law 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> session 
The <nulltag> scourge </nulltag> of <nulltag> international </nulltag> terrorism <nulltag> threatens </nulltag> the Middle East, North Africa, the Sahel region and sub-Saharan Africa, the Gulf region and Europe. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> International </nulltag> Trade Centre (ITC) is the <nulltag> joint </nulltag> technical cooperation agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO) for trade and international business development. 
An <nulltag> Israeli </nulltag> <nulltag> enemy </nulltag> reconnaissance aircraft <nulltag> violated </nulltag> Lebanese airspace, entering over Alma al-Sha`b. 
<nulltag> Reaffirming </nulltag> its <nulltag> full </nulltag> support <nulltag> for, </nulltag> and commitment to, the efforts of the United Nations and the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Yemen, in particular to the UN-brokered negotiations, and its support for the efforts of the Group of Ambassadors in Sana'a, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> indicated </nulltag> in the <nulltag> briefing </nulltag> to the Security Council by the Commissioner General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Pierre Krähenbühl, the situation in the Yarmouk refugee camp has precipitously deteriorated following the 2 April takeover of the camp by terrorists affiliated with ISIL and other terror groups. 
We <nulltag> echo </nulltag> the <nulltag> appeals </nulltag> made by you that the world "cannot stand by and watch a massacre unfold" and that <nulltag> "the </nulltag> people of Yarmouk must not be abandoned", and we call on the Council to act urgently and responsibly to address this tragedy. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> related </nulltag> to fraud; and 
<nulltag> According </nulltag> to the <nulltag> Secretary-General, </nulltag> the <nulltag> unencumbered </nulltag> balance for 2014 relates mainly to a reduced number of trips undertaken by staff, as the result of the institution of a stricter travel policy (ibid., para. 186). 
<nulltag> UNRWA </nulltag> <nulltag> reached </nulltag> more than 14,000 <nulltag> Palestine </nulltag> refugees in community-awareness and prevention activities relating to gender-based violence, children's and human rights, domestic violence, neglect and sexual abuse. 
39. The <nulltag> United </nulltag> Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) <nulltag> established </nulltag> 12 libraries (10 in the West Bank and 2 in Gaza) <nulltag> accessible </nulltag> to persons with disabilities and trained 10 newly recruited librarians. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the <nulltag> final </nulltag> disposition of assets of the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee was <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that some assets in group I were transferred to the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria. 
<nulltag> UNICEF </nulltag> also <nulltag> completed </nulltag> the transportation of supplies across the border in April, including 330,000 litres of <nulltag> water, </nulltag> midwifery kits and sanitation and hygiene kits. 
In the <nulltag> interview, </nulltag> Mr. Rama <nulltag> stated </nulltag> that "Albania and Kosovo will unite in a <nulltag> classical </nulltag> way" if the European Union does not open the way for the integration of Kosovo and visa liberalization. 
It is the <nulltag> organization's </nulltag> <nulltag> mission </nulltag> to <nulltag> eradicate </nulltag> hunger and poverty and promote peace and justice in the United States and globally. 
During the <nulltag> reporting </nulltag> <nulltag> period, </nulltag> the organization participated in the <nulltag> following </nulltag> meetings: 
The <nulltag> City </nulltag> Prosperity Index also has the <nulltag> potential </nulltag> to <nulltag> integrate </nulltag> new indicators in a reciprocal manner as the process of sustainable development goal indicator formulation evolves. 
The <nulltag> expansion </nulltag> of cities and <nulltag> large </nulltag> towns is due to natural population growth within urban <nulltag> areas, </nulltag> the administrative reclassification of land from rural to urban and migration from rural areas. 
21. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> with satisfaction the efforts <nulltag> made </nulltag> by the Secretariat to implement <nulltag> joint </nulltag> procurement with United Nations system organizations, and emphasizes that, when it does so, the four general principles of financial regulation 5.12 shall apply; 
I should be <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> if you would have the present <nulltag> letter </nulltag> and its annex <nulltag> brought </nulltag> to the attention of the members of the Security Council and issued as a document of the Council. 
We should <nulltag> like </nulltag> to recall <nulltag> that, </nulltag> since 2011, the approach taken by GCC States to the situation in Yemen has been founded on supporting a <nulltag> democratic </nulltag> political transition based on the GCC initiative, which has come to be known as the Gulf initiative, and the outcomes of the All-Inclusive National Dialogue Conference; continuing the dialogue among all Yemini parties, under Yemeni leadership; supporting the President and the legitimate Government; and doing what is possible to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. 
Since their <nulltag> endorsement </nulltag> by the General Assembly in 2001, the Goals have <nulltag> risen </nulltag> to the top of the <nulltag> global </nulltag> development agenda and are the common focus of priorities for the development community. 
<nulltag> Selection </nulltag> and appointment process for United Nations Resident Coordinators, <nulltag> including </nulltag> <nulltag> preparation, </nulltag> training and support provided for their work 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> actions </nulltag> to be <nulltag> taken </nulltag> by the General Assembly are as follows: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Tuesday, </nulltag> 14 April 2015, at 11.09 a.m. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> April </nulltag> 2015 
<nulltag> Several </nulltag> <nulltag> representatives </nulltag> also <nulltag> raised </nulltag> the issue of modern communications technology being used to infringe citizens' right to privacy in contravention of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
2. The <nulltag> general </nulltag> <nulltag> debate </nulltag> was <nulltag> preceded </nulltag> by statements by the outgoing Chair of the Committee, Lyutha Al-Mughairy, and the newly elected Chair, Kaha Imnadze. 
The <nulltag> Joint </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> approved </nulltag> convoys to 16 <nulltag> locations, </nulltag> 8 of which were on the list of 33 locations requested by the United Nations for inter-agency convoys. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> must be <nulltag> allowed </nulltag> to get on with the <nulltag> job </nulltag> of saving lives. 
<nulltag> Joint </nulltag> <nulltag> discussions </nulltag> could be <nulltag> held </nulltag> regularly on common thematic areas, taking into account also the annual main theme of the Economic and Social Council. 
9. <nulltag> Many </nulltag> <nulltag> participants </nulltag> <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> that the humanitarian initiative had been gaining increasing momentum, but at the same time expressed their concerns that nuclear-weapon states are unlikely to take a lead role or fully cooperate in a process to ban and eliminate nuclear weapons. 
<nulltag> Anyone </nulltag> and everyone <nulltag> responsible </nulltag> for the use of chemical weapons must be <nulltag> identified </nulltag> and held accountable in a court of law; 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> notes that a summary of the assets <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> for donation to the Government was included in that report and regrets that such information on the <nulltag> final </nulltag> disposition of assets was omitted from the present report. 
<nulltag> Please </nulltag> also <nulltag> indicate </nulltag> whether trade unions and <nulltag> women's </nulltag> associations have standing to lodge discrimination complaints and which remedies they can seek, or whether some other system is in place to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination legislation. 
<nulltag> Please </nulltag> also <nulltag> indicate </nulltag> what steps have been taken or are envisaged to address <nulltag> stereotypical </nulltag> attitudes towards Roma women and girls and to accelerate their achievement of de facto equality. 
<nulltag> Thanks </nulltag> to its capabilities, the satellite can be <nulltag> used </nulltag> to broadcast television and radio channels, transmit data between ground stations located thousands of kilometres from one another, and provide broadband Internet services, distance learning and <nulltag> tele-medicine, </nulltag> including through videoconferencing, and other types of communication services. 
In <nulltag> Aleppo </nulltag> alone, at <nulltag> least </nulltag> 72 civilians were <nulltag> killed </nulltag> as a result of Syrian regime air strikes. 
In that <nulltag> context, </nulltag> they <nulltag> noted </nulltag> that the <nulltag> upcoming </nulltag> Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, to be held in April 2015, would provide an important opportunity for Member States and stakeholders to reaffirm a global response to challenges of crime prevention and criminal justice. 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> report, </nulltag> <nulltag> submitted </nulltag> pursuant to paragraph 26 of Security Council resolution 2164 (2014), describes the actions undertaken by French forces in support of MINUSMA from 3 December 2014 to 23 February 2015. 
22. The <nulltag> introduction </nulltag> of <nulltag> topical </nulltag> peer reviews was largely <nulltag> inspired </nulltag> by the peer review process conducted during the nuclear stress tests undertaken after the Fukushima accident. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> paper </nulltag> submitted by the European Union 
The <nulltag> delivery </nulltag> of the <nulltag> essential </nulltag> package of health services was <nulltag> rolled </nulltag> out in 39 districts, covering 76.7 per cent of the target population and benefiting more than 25,000 pregnant women and 118,000 children under 5. 
The <nulltag> Trust </nulltag> Fund <nulltag> received </nulltag> <nulltag> total </nulltag> contributions of $16.1 million from the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, New Zealand, Denmark and Sweden. 
14. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> States parties and <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> organizations in a position to do so to provide assistance, in particular to States parties that are developing countries, in order to enhance access to nuclear science and technology, through various measures including capacity-building, the provision of equipment, strengthening regional networking and regional cooperation frameworks and facilitating cooperation among developing countries. 
The <nulltag> need </nulltag> to <nulltag> protect </nulltag> such information and <nulltag> national </nulltag> security interests may require specific protection measures and procedures to be implemented, including managed access (paragraphs 9 to 11). 
These <nulltag> arrangements </nulltag> shall be <nulltag> detailed </nulltag> in <nulltag> specific </nulltag> agreements between the Organization and the State party in question. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Task </nulltag> Force <nulltag> comprises </nulltag> designees of each member of the President's Cabinet and the Co-Chairs of the President's Inter-Agency Group on Puerto Rico. 
Foremost, the <nulltag> evidence </nulltag> <nulltag> presented </nulltag> in the course of the conferences underscored the urgency of <nulltag> concrete </nulltag> progress on nuclear disarmament and the achievement of a world without nuclear weapons. 
<nulltag> Mindful </nulltag> that no <nulltag> national </nulltag> or international response capacity <nulltag> exists </nulltag> that would adequately respond to the human suffering and humanitarian harm that would result from a nuclear-weapon explosion in a populated area and that such capacity most likely will never exist, 
It would be an <nulltag> incomprehensible </nulltag> and unjustifiable <nulltag> irony </nulltag> if, instead being duly punished, the party that has <nulltag> obstructed </nulltag> and stalled is rewarded for its intransigence, as would be the case if the fundamental elements that define the conflict were to be abandoned, including decolonization, the right to self-determination, the protection of human rights and ending the plundering of natural resources in a non-self-governing territory, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, Chapter XI, Article 73. 
<nulltag> Increased </nulltag> <nulltag> percentage </nulltag> of air tickets purchased by the Organization at <nulltag> least </nulltag> two weeks before the commencement of the travel 
<nulltag> Accordingly, </nulltag> I <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to inform you that, after consulting with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014), I have appointed the <nulltag> following </nulltag> experts: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council has been <nulltag> informed </nulltag> of that request (letter dated 24 March 2015 from the Permanent Representative of Yemen to the United Nations). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Sector Reform Unit 
The <nulltag> total </nulltag> <nulltag> expenditure </nulltag> for the period <nulltag> amounted </nulltag> to $59,343,200 gross ($57,980,500 net), which is $1,311,300 gross ($1,284,000 net) lower than the amount appropriated by the Assembly, corresponding to a budget implementation rate of 97.8 per cent. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> under review: 15 November 2014 to 15 March 2015 
On 15 <nulltag> September </nulltag> 2014, MINUSCA <nulltag> took </nulltag> over from the <nulltag> African-led </nulltag> International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA).

The <nulltag> following </nulltag> <nulltag> groups </nulltag> and delegations <nulltag> delivered </nulltag> statements: the Philippines, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China; Benin, on behalf of the LDCs; the United Republic of Tanzania, on behalf of the African Group; the European Union and its member States; Uruguay, on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group; the Philippines, on behalf of the Asian Group; Switzerland, on behalf of the JUSSCANNZ group; Bangladesh; Ethiopia; Morocco; China and Kenya. 
20. The <nulltag> results </nulltag> of such <nulltag> vast </nulltag> reforms were <nulltag> reassuring: </nulltag> in 2013, its gross domestic product (GDP) had grown to 6.5 per cent (almost the double the rate of 2011); inflation, at 1 per cent, had finally been brought under control and the budget deficit had been substantially reduced down to 3.6 per cent of GDP. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to alteration and <nulltag> improvement, </nulltag> a provision of $10,456,400 would cover the following: 
The <nulltag> Team </nulltag> has <nulltag> received </nulltag> a <nulltag> great </nulltag> deal of information from Member States in response to visits and our written request for submissions. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> States may also have <nulltag> differing </nulltag> methodologies for counting those who have been killed or have left a conflict zone. 
<nulltag> Operational </nulltag> <nulltag> costs </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> its <nulltag> resolutions </nulltag> 1267 (1999), 1373 (2001), 1624 (2005), 1989 (2011), 2161 (2014), 2170 (2014), 2174 (2014), 2178 (2014), 2195 (2014) and 2199 (2015), and its <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> presidential statements, 
<nulltag> Expressing </nulltag> <nulltag> grave </nulltag> concerns over the growing trend of <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> groups in Libya that proclaim allegiance to ISIL, 
<nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Ould Cheikh Ahmed currently <nulltag> serves </nulltag> as my <nulltag> Special </nulltag> Representative and Head of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> monitoring supports development <nulltag> processes </nulltag> and, through its practice, results are owned by the rights holders, with all involved parties working together to reach goals and targets. 
3. Under these <nulltag> measures, </nulltag> <nulltag> payments </nulltag> to or <nulltag> by, </nulltag> and capital transactions with, those designated by the Committee are subject to licensing by the Minister of Finance or the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
<nulltag> Goods </nulltag> and technologies <nulltag> described </nulltag> on the list of the Orders correspond to the goods and technologies controlled by the <nulltag> international </nulltag> export control regime, in particular the Wassenaar Arrangement. 
The <nulltag> Group </nulltag> <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> also that, at the Conference, States parties renewed their resolve to undertake, individually and collectively, all <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> measures aimed at its prompt implementation. 
12. The <nulltag> DAT </nulltag> will <nulltag> continue </nulltag> its <nulltag> technical </nulltag> consultations and its interviews with key principals from the Syrian chemical weapons programme, and undertake possible additional site visits involving sampling and analysis. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> installation </nulltag> of cables and construction of the base stations for the other two structures is <nulltag> nearing </nulltag> completion. 
<nulltag> Many </nulltag> <nulltag> representatives </nulltag> <nulltag> expressed </nulltag> the view that the meeting could contribute to, and allow for greater understanding of, the post-2015 development agenda process and several suggested that the present summary could be brought to the attention of the co-facilitators of the intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. 
In <nulltag> particular, </nulltag> <nulltag> questions </nulltag> were <nulltag> posed </nulltag> regarding the possible role of technology, such as cellular phones, how to increase the participation of women in fisheries to increase productivity and how to tackle the impacts on the livelihoods of local communities when conservation and management measures were put in place. 
6. <nulltag> Additional </nulltag> <nulltag> conference-servicing </nulltag> requirements of $670,000 for the biennium 2016-2017 under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, would be <nulltag> required </nulltag> under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2016-2017 to implement the additional workload. 
To <nulltag> address </nulltag> the <nulltag> shortcomings </nulltag> of the <nulltag> former </nulltag> research and training coordination committee, the new committee will operate under the guidance of the Secretary-General and will focus on concrete initiatives for enhanced results through collaboration between the members. 
To <nulltag> respond </nulltag> to <nulltag> new </nulltag> and emerging issues, the United Nations urgently needs to scale up its <nulltag> capacity </nulltag> to provide training at all levels, in the form of learning opportunities for nationals of Member States, including government officials, and for nongovernmental organizations and private sector entities, as well as training opportunities for United Nations staff members in all locations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> item 129 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Military <nulltag> armed </nulltag> vehicles or Military vehicles equipped with <nulltag> weapon </nulltag> mounts. 
34. <nulltag> Asks </nulltag> the Group of Experts to <nulltag> assess </nulltag> the effectiveness of these border measures and control in the region, encourages all neighbouring States to be <nulltag> aware </nulltag> of Ivorian efforts in that regard and encourages UNOCI, within its mandate, to continue its assistance to Ivorian authorities in the re-establishment of normal customs and border control operation; 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> to you a letter dated 17 March 2015 from the representative of the National Coalition of <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> Revolution and Opposition Forces (see annex). 
They should no longer <nulltag> dare </nulltag> pull up the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> <nulltag> People's </nulltag> Republic of Korea over all its measures to bolster up its military muscle for self-defence, terming them "provocation" and "threat". 
This is because the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council has been <nulltag> reduced </nulltag> to an entity that yields to the <nulltag> high-handed </nulltag> and arbitrary practices of the United States, forgetful of its mission to ensure global peace and security and its duty as prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations, and one which has itself abandoned the principles of respect for sovereignty of other countries and non-interference in their internal affairs after dropping the principle of impartiality. 
On the <nulltag> basis </nulltag> of its consultations with <nulltag> various </nulltag> <nulltag> stakeholders, </nulltag> the outcome of the discussions with UNOCA staff members and informed by its own observations and risk assessment, the review team adopted a series of recommendations. 
The <nulltag> resolution </nulltag> of the conflict is <nulltag> possible </nulltag> only on the basis of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally <nulltag> recognized </nulltag> borders. 
Since <nulltag> then, </nulltag> Iran has <nulltag> called </nulltag> for <nulltag> timely </nulltag> implementation of the plan of action which included, inter alia, an agreement to convene a regional conference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. 
<nulltag> Underlining </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the <nulltag> economic </nulltag> and geo-economic aspects of the neutrality of Turkmenistan for regional interconnectivity, which is conducive to regional development, and, in this regard, welcoming the initiatives of Turkmenistan on the stable transit of energy and the development of reliable transport and transit corridors, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> sincerely shares the suffering of the Armenians in that <nulltag> tragic </nulltag> episode of history. 
The <nulltag> Co-Chairs </nulltag> <nulltag> outlined </nulltag> three priorities in that regard: first, to facilitate <nulltag> early </nulltag> dialogue and timely consultation on United Nations security sector reform strategies in country contexts; second, to support cooperation and security sector reform partnerships on the ground; and third, to lead intergovernmental dialogue and consensus-building on key security sector reform principles, as well as on different thematic areas of security sector reform. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> This <nulltag> component </nulltag> of subprogramme 3 is the responsibility of the Medical Services Division of the Office of Human Resources Management. 
A <nulltag> group </nulltag> of delegations <nulltag> reiterated </nulltag> the recommendation of the <nulltag> previous </nulltag> President of the Executive Board that UNICEF develop a clear and comprehensive strategic action plan for Africa's children. 
They <nulltag> stressed </nulltag> that youth-friendly <nulltag> services </nulltag> that linked <nulltag> sexual </nulltag> and reproductive health with HIV were critical. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be to God and peace upon the Messenger of God 
They <nulltag> noted, </nulltag> with <nulltag> concern, </nulltag> that some <nulltag> foreign </nulltag> terrorist groups have found safe haven in parts of Libya and expressed serious concern at the negative consequences of the current situation on the country, as well as on regional peace, security and stability. 
They also <nulltag> commended </nulltag> <nulltag> Operation </nulltag> Sangaris and the European Union <nulltag> military </nulltag> operation in the Central African Republic for the work done in laying the foundation for increased security ahead of and in support of the deployment of MINUSCA. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Tuesday, </nulltag> 24 March 2015, at 3 p.m. 
The <nulltag> non-legally </nulltag> <nulltag> binding </nulltag> instrument <nulltag> provides </nulltag> such a framework. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Commission 
15. <nulltag> Stresses </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> to ensure <nulltag> better </nulltag> cooperation and coordination at the international level, including among the United Nations and relevant international regional and sub-regional organizations, including through technical assistance and capacity-building, with regard to promoting and ensuring the safety of journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in armed conflicts; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> fully <nulltag> endorsed </nulltag> recommendation 3, and would welcome the expansion of the Associate Expert Programme through the participation of more Member States in the programme and in the financing of candidates from developing countries. 
For example, a <nulltag> delegation </nulltag> that <nulltag> supported </nulltag> a <nulltag> substantive </nulltag> activity being authorized by the Council would adopt a negative attitude in the Fifth Committee with respect to allocating adequate resources for implementing the resolution. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> During the <nulltag> reporting </nulltag> <nulltag> period, </nulltag> the Department published volume 64 (2010) of the Yearbook of the United Nations and continued to work on volume 65 (2011). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Media </nulltag> Accreditation and Liaison Unit <nulltag> provided </nulltag> accreditation and escort to media representatives covering the meetings of the Special Committee on decolonization. 
The <nulltag> atrocities </nulltag> and <nulltag> blatant </nulltag> violations that have been <nulltag> perpetrated </nulltag> over the course of four years against the Syrian people by a regime that is supposed to be that people's primary protector demonstrates the utter failure of the manner in which the international community has dealt with the officials involved in those crimes. 
22. On 4 <nulltag> March, </nulltag> some 200 demonstrators <nulltag> blocked </nulltag> a <nulltag> main </nulltag> road in Zorzor, Lofa County, to protest at the death of a woman of the Loma ethnic group, who they alleged had been killed by a suspect of the Mandingo ethnic group. 
The <nulltag> extension </nulltag> is <nulltag> requested </nulltag> by the Government to maintain alignment with the national planning cycle, itself extended by one year following the <nulltag> recent </nulltag> national elections. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> on the agenda, modalities and outcomes for the Conference have all been <nulltag> tabled </nulltag> informally for discussion. 
2. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum has <nulltag> identified </nulltag> the proposals, <nulltag> objectives, </nulltag> recommendations and areas of possible future action set out below and, through the Council, recommends that States, entities of the United Nations system, intergovernmental organizations, indigenous peoples, the private sector and nongovernmental organizations assist in their realization. 
The <nulltag> partnership </nulltag> between the <nulltag> public </nulltag> sector, the private sector, <nulltag> cooperating </nulltag> partners and civil society is vital. 
<nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> provisions </nulltag> were <nulltag> made </nulltag> regarding the effect of the decision with regard to existing contracts and applications received before 25 July 2013, the date when the decision entered into effect. 
<nulltag> Please </nulltag> <nulltag> provide </nulltag> information on steps taken to put in place a system to collect data on all aspects of women's health, including the monitoring of <nulltag> concrete </nulltag> impact, as previously requested by the Committee (ibid., para. 38). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
14. <nulltag> Reaffirms </nulltag> its commitment to the renovation of the Dag Hammarskjöld Library and South Annex Buildings, and <nulltag> requests </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to submit to the General Assembly for its consideration and approval future proposals relating to the renovation of these two buildings as separate projects outside of the scope of the capital master plan through established procedures; 
6. <nulltag> Authorizes </nulltag> the <nulltag> members </nulltag> of the Advisory Committee, pending a decision of the General Assembly on the recommendations mentioned in paragraph 4 (a) above, to enrol in the United Nations health insurance plans at their own expense, in accordance with the rules and procedures set out in the <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> information circular; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Tuesday, </nulltag> 26 May 2015, at 10 a.m. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that, according to the Secretary-General, such expertise was not <nulltag> available </nulltag> among local actors, although local actors are involved in project implementation while UNMIK remains responsible for the identification of the projects. 
In addition, the <nulltag> effects </nulltag> of the disease in Liberia have <nulltag> affected </nulltag> the delivery of the Mission's mandate, owing to unrest among the <nulltag> local </nulltag> populations and the weakening of Liberian institutions that are critical to the ongoing stabilization of the country and the development of its security forces. 
At the <nulltag> outset, </nulltag> <nulltag> regarding </nulltag> the claims of <nulltag> so-called </nulltag> "infringements of international air traffic regulations" and "violations of the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkey", I wish, once again, to reiterate that flights within the sovereign airspace of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus take place with the full knowledge and consent of the relevant authorities of the State, over which the Greek Cypriot administration in South Cyprus has no jurisdiction or right of say whatsoever. 
By <nulltag> invoking </nulltag> an alleged and <nulltag> implausible </nulltag> <nulltag> Argentine </nulltag> "threat", the United Kingdom seeks to justify a military presence typical of a colonial Power. 
10. <nulltag> Between </nulltag> October 2013 and June 2014 the facilitator together with the conveners of the Conference and with the participation of States of the region held five <nulltag> informal </nulltag> meetings in Glion and Geneva, Switzerland, in order to <nulltag> facilitate </nulltag> agreement among the States of the region on the arrangements for the Conference to be held in Helsinki. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> contributed </nulltag> actively to the dialogue and presented proposals. 
<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> the <nulltag> call </nulltag> made in the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development for the strengthening of <nulltag> international </nulltag> tax cooperation through enhanced dialogue among national tax authorities and greater coordination of the work of the multilateral bodies and relevant regional organizations concerned, giving special attention to the needs of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, 
In <nulltag> Quebec, </nulltag> the <nulltag> homologating </nulltag> court only examines the legality of the act and as a <nulltag> general </nulltag> rule it cannot rule on its advisability or merits (sec. 527 and 528 N.C.p.c.). 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> it should <nulltag> deal </nulltag> with a matter on which settlement can be reached in accordance with <nulltag> Ecuadorian </nulltag> law. 
The <nulltag> main </nulltag> <nulltag> benefits </nulltag> of harmonized indicators <nulltag> include </nulltag> having a platform for unifying various reports, providing guidance for Governments, the United Nations system, civil society organizations and other stakeholders, contributing to increasing efficiency and effectiveness of Governments, contributing to inter-agency coordination and collaboration, assisting in the coordination between the national and local levels, guiding policymakers in budgeting and in viewing international obligations in conjunction with national priorities. 
Currently <nulltag> little </nulltag> is <nulltag> known </nulltag> about tiny <nulltag> debris </nulltag> and micrometeoroids in outer space, although having such information is essential for impact risk assessment, for spacecraft survivability analysis, and for designing cost-effective protection for spacecraft. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Japan, </nulltag> activities <nulltag> relating </nulltag> to space debris are mainly conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> <nulltag> evaluation </nulltag> resources will be <nulltag> used </nulltag> to conduct eight evaluations of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs: four evaluations of field response emergencies and four evaluations of key thematic issues on topics to be determined by the senior management team. 
All the <nulltag> planned </nulltag> <nulltag> consultations </nulltag> with the stakeholders have already been completed and the <nulltag> first </nulltag> draft of the post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction has been developed. 
21. <nulltag> Flexibility </nulltag> and innovation should <nulltag> drive </nulltag> the design of <nulltag> inclusive </nulltag> and effective institutional strategies for effective service delivery. 
It is <nulltag> intended </nulltag> as a <nulltag> tool </nulltag> for integrating all three dimensions of <nulltag> sustainable </nulltag> development into policymaking, taking into account long-term effects for future generations as well as spillover effects on other countries outside the Union. 
The <nulltag> workshop </nulltag> fact sheets <nulltag> describe </nulltag> these in detail, including for 10 <nulltag> main </nulltag> markets and at least 30 subsectors. 
<nulltag> Encouraging </nulltag> the <nulltag> parties </nulltag> to continue in their <nulltag> respective </nulltag> efforts to enhance the promotion and protection of human rights in Western Sahara and the Tindouf refugee camps, including the freedoms of expression and association, 
<nulltag> Affirming </nulltag> <nulltag> full </nulltag> <nulltag> support </nulltag> for the Secretary-General's Personal Envoy for Western Sahara Ambassador Christopher Ross and his work in facilitating negotiations between the parties, and, welcoming to that effect his recent initiatives and ongoing consultations with the parties and neighbouring states, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> recommendation </nulltag> (c), the scope and authorities between the Transport and Movement Integrated Control Centre and Strategic Air Operations Centre have been <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> and endorsed by the Regional Service Centre Steering Committee (the governing body of the Transport and Movement Integrated Control Centre). 
It is <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> that with the <nulltag> services </nulltag> provided by the four <nulltag> additional </nulltag> temporary staff, the project would be completed within a two-year timeframe. 
The <nulltag> Bribery </nulltag> Act <nulltag> provides </nulltag> that <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> offences may be subject to imprisonment for up to seven years and up to ten years for corruption (section 70). 
<nulltag> Specialized </nulltag> <nulltag> authorities </nulltag> and inter-agency coordination <nulltag> (arts. </nulltag> 36, 38 and 39) 
<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the 7444th meeting of the Security Council 
<nulltag> Efforts </nulltag> will <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to be made to make <nulltag> human </nulltag> resources management a shared responsibility of programme managers and to strengthen the partnership between individual staff members and supervisors as well as the assistance provided in continued competency development. 
The <nulltag> net </nulltag> <nulltag> decrease </nulltag> of $352,800 <nulltag> relates </nulltag> primarily to the proposed freezing of recruitment against established posts ($406,800). 
<nulltag> Violence </nulltag> and <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> acts <nulltag> continued </nulltag> during the reporting period, causing loss of life and great suffering and fear among many innocent Lebanese from all communities nationwide. 
Furthermore, the <nulltag> first </nulltag> <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> of the preamble of the NPT itself <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> that this is based on the need to avoid the devastations that a nuclear war would visit on all mankind. 
<nulltag> Similar </nulltag> <nulltag> measures </nulltag> would be very important for <nulltag> strengthening </nulltag> nuclear non-proliferation. 
The <nulltag> lack </nulltag> of accommodation and <nulltag> food, </nulltag> failure to <nulltag> adapt </nulltag> to new climatic conditions and the rapid spread of diseases had a heavy demographic impact during the first years of exile. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> it <nulltag> intends </nulltag> to resolutely promote the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> it <nulltag> intends </nulltag> to convene a <nulltag> high-level </nulltag> meeting in 2016 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Council. 
For <nulltag> example, </nulltag> it is <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> that rebuilding <nulltag> overfished </nulltag> stocks could increase fishery production by 16.5 million tons and annual revenue by $32 billion, which would certainly increase the contribution of marine fisheries to the food security, economies and well-being of coastal communities.25 
These <nulltag> capacity-building </nulltag> <nulltag> requirements </nulltag> are particularly high for small island <nulltag> developing </nulltag> States. 
7. As <nulltag> shown </nulltag> in the <nulltag> table </nulltag> under paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General's statement, the <nulltag> total </nulltag> requirements for 2015 are currently estimated at $101,600, of which $4,000 has been identified for absorption within the approved appropriation for section 28, Public information, of the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 (see subpara. (b) below). 
Upon <nulltag> instructions </nulltag> from my Government, I would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to draw your attention to the provocative and <nulltag> aggressive </nulltag> statement made by the Israeli Defence Minister, Moshe Yaalon, on 5 May 2015, at the Shurat HaDin Law of War Conference in Jerusalem, in which he threatened to use nuclear bombs against Iran and to continue killing civilians, including women and children, in Gaza and Lebanon. 
<nulltag> Moreover, </nulltag> the occupying forces <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to fire at <nulltag> civilian </nulltag> demonstrators, including, most recently, during demonstrations marking World Press Freedom Day, during which at least 13 Palestinians, including two children and five journalists, were injured. 
2.10 The <nulltag> Court </nulltag> of Appeal <nulltag> considered </nulltag> the <nulltag> authors' </nulltag> appeal on 7 December 2010 and dismissed it on 22 December 2010. 
Immediately thereafter, her <nulltag> brother-in-law </nulltag> <nulltag> ordered </nulltag> her to vacate the house where she was living, and she was told that under Sukuma <nulltag> customary </nulltag> law she could not inherit her husband's estate.

<nulltag> Affirm </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Arab </nulltag> States are <nulltag> concerned </nulltag> primarily with achieving security for their peoples, that the 2012 Conference represents a fork in the road in respect of their nuclear policies, and that the failure of the conference would require them to review their nuclear policies and to adopt alternatives to ensure their security. 
Its <nulltag> therapeutic </nulltag> <nulltag> usefulness </nulltag> had been <nulltag> assessed </nulltag> to be none.

Over the <nulltag> past </nulltag> few <nulltag> days, </nulltag> the visual, audio and print media have <nulltag> carried </nulltag> statements made by some Yemeni officials and some fabricated reports alleging that the Houthis are receiving support from Iran via Eritrea. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> visited </nulltag> <nulltag> Burundi </nulltag> from 31 March to 3 April 2015 to pursue the Commission's engagement with Burundi. 
The <nulltag> President </nulltag> of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, in his address in Geneva on 18 February 2015 stated: "We <nulltag> know </nulltag> now more than ever before that the risks are too <nulltag> high, </nulltag> the dangers too real.

Of the 26 <nulltag> recommendations, </nulltag> 10 <nulltag> related </nulltag> to country office recommendations from audits completed in the <nulltag> first </nulltag> half of 2013 and one to a 2010 audit.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> United </nulltag> Kingdom-Norway Initiative was <nulltag> established </nulltag> in 2007. 
Those <nulltag> accusations </nulltag> were <nulltag> endorsed </nulltag> by an official of the United Nations Office in Burundi (BNUB), who sent a <nulltag> confidential </nulltag> cable to the United Nations accusing the Government of distributing weapons to civilians, whereas, on the contrary, operations to recover weapons kept illegally by civilians are proving remarkably successful. 
The <nulltag> latest </nulltag> <nulltag> statistics, </nulltag> which were <nulltag> confirmed </nulltag> by the Burundian and Rwandan sides on a recent visit of the Burundian authorities to Rwanda, indicate that fewer than 2,000 people are involved, and that refugees are returning voluntarily to their hills of origin in Burundi.

2. We <nulltag> call </nulltag> for the <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of an <nulltag> independent </nulltag> Global Youth Council that would consist of outstanding young people, with a view to discussing problems and challenges which are endemic to their communities and are to be taken into consideration when designing appropriate crime prevention and criminal justice responses, and collaborating to find solutions through project development. 
We <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> to take or strengthen measures, to alleviate the factors that make persons <nulltag> vulnerable </nulltag> to trafficking, violence, drug abuse, poverty, underdevelopment and lack of equal opportunity.

In that <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> noted that a broader geographic <nulltag> diversity </nulltag> among the staff is a priority concern for the entire Secretariat and accordingly that targets for recruitment of unrepresented and underrepresented nationalities are applied to the Secretariat as a whole and are included in the senior manager compacts with the Secretary-General. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the fact that the members of the Conference have considered such proposals and are implementing some of the recommendations made with regard to its working methods, but it is also of the view that members of the Conference should now urgently reassess the Conference's working methods in depth. 
<nulltag> Switzerland </nulltag> strongly <nulltag> believes </nulltag> that obligations and commitments in all the three pillars are inextricably <nulltag> linked, </nulltag> which is why unfulfilled commitments in any of the three pillars have a negative impact on the other pillars, and thus on the Treaty as a whole. 
The Government of Yemen <nulltag> requests </nulltag> the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council to demand that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran stop its <nulltag> continued </nulltag> intervention in Yemeni affairs, as such an irresponsible action represents a flagrant attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of Yemen and an attempt to undermine its legitimate Government.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> to the <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, this sort of action only complicates the resolution of problems in the region. 
The <nulltag> report </nulltag> of the Audit Advisory Committee and <nulltag> related </nulltag> management response will also be <nulltag> presented </nulltag> to the Executive Board.

I <nulltag> count </nulltag> on your <nulltag> leadership </nulltag> in taking forward this <nulltag> important </nulltag> issue, in particular through the early dispatch to Ukraine of a preliminary assessment mission as requested by President Poroshenko, so as to bring, as soon as possible, lasting peace and stability to the affected areas of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Ukraine in accordance with the Minsk agreements.

We <nulltag> believe </nulltag> this to be an <nulltag> important </nulltag> and necessary <nulltag> step </nulltag> towards holding the perpetrators of crimes against children responsible for their actions, contributing to the efforts to end impunity and protecting children in all situations of armed conflict, without exception. 
<nulltag> Switzerland </nulltag> <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the fact that some reports by the <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States on their undertakings to implement actions 5 (e) and 5 (f) of the action plan included information about the operational status of nuclear weapons but regrets that no new elements regarding operational readiness were contained in those reports. 
<nulltag> Switzerland </nulltag> <nulltag> urges </nulltag> the <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States to fully implement their obligations under article VI of the Treaty and to engage in good-faith negotiations on further nuclear disarmament steps. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> International </nulltag> Seabed Authority is among the organizations <nulltag> participating </nulltag> in the Commission. 
3. <nulltag> Affirm </nulltag> that much more transparency over nuclear weapons programmes in <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States is <nulltag> required </nulltag> in order to verify progress in the field of vertical proliferation and to assess progress, as well as the pace of any such progress, in the field of nuclear disarmament. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Mission's </nulltag> headquarters in Accra <nulltag> includes </nulltag> the Office of the Special Representative and the offices of the Directors of Emergency Operations, Emergency Operations Support and Mission Support. 
It may be <nulltag> useful </nulltag> to <nulltag> recall </nulltag> that <nulltag> Resolution </nulltag> 2153 of 17 November 1966, which advocated concluding a non-proliferation treaty, at the same time asked the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament to review as a matter of urgency the issue of negative security assurances. 
I <nulltag> therefore </nulltag> <nulltag> welcome </nulltag> <nulltag> President </nulltag> Ouattara's commitment in that regard, as well as the allocation of an initial tranche of funds to cover reparations to victims. 
1. Over the <nulltag> years, </nulltag> the 63 States Members of the United Nations <nulltag> listed </nulltag> below have offered to make scholarships <nulltag> available </nulltag> for the use of inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories in response to the relevant General Assembly resolutions:

16. <nulltag> Efforts </nulltag> by the IAEA to <nulltag> improve </nulltag> the safeguards regime and make it more <nulltag> effective </nulltag> and efficient, through its conceptualization and implementation at the state level, should in no way restrict, or call into question, the inalienable right of States parties to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
The <nulltag> Review </nulltag> Conference should <nulltag> encourage </nulltag> States that can do so, to continue and increase their <nulltag> off-budget </nulltag> voluntary contributions, as complementary funding, for technical cooperation activities targeting peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

Two <nulltag> (2) </nulltag> <nulltag> Hizbullah </nulltag> militants were <nulltag> observed </nulltag> performing military recce IVO B21. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Development Officer position <nulltag> redeployed </nulltag> from Human Resources Management Section 
<nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Kay <nulltag> said </nulltag> that while 2014 had seen <nulltag> important </nulltag> progress in the campaign against Al-Shabaab, the State formation process and the establishment of some key institutions in Somalia, more progress was needed and that 2015 must be the year of federalism and delivery. 
During the <nulltag> closed </nulltag> <nulltag> consultations </nulltag> that <nulltag> followed </nulltag> that meeting, Council members condemned the brutal killing of 21 Egyptian citizens in Libya and expressed condolences to the Egyptian Government and its people. 
8. The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of Burundi <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> that compliance with the laws in force and the <nulltag> legal </nulltag> mechanisms for demands of a political nature is not negotiable and that those who break the law will be brought to justice. 
<nulltag> UNIDO </nulltag> will <nulltag> place </nulltag> <nulltag> particular </nulltag> emphasis on joining forces with business and industry to harness the financial and non-financial input of the private sector needed to create shared value for all. 
They <nulltag> aim </nulltag> at ensuring that rehiring and <nulltag> retention </nulltag> in <nulltag> senior </nulltag> executive and general service positions are restricted to instances where needs cannot be met otherwise than through employing retirees as consultants (recommendation 4). 
Those who <nulltag> participated </nulltag> in the <nulltag> war </nulltag> or laboured on the home front <nulltag> receive </nulltag> assistance each year in the form of free medical care, treatments at sanatoria and health resorts, and other necessary support. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> work </nulltag> over the period under review has <nulltag> included </nulltag> advocating issues such as: 
The <nulltag> organization </nulltag> <nulltag> attended </nulltag> the <nulltag> following </nulltag> meetings: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> For <nulltag> persistent </nulltag> <nulltag> objection </nulltag> to be effective, it must be clearly expressed. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> memorandum </nulltag> <nulltag> included </nulltag> five "observations" referring to these matters, with examples. 
While there is no <nulltag> net </nulltag> <nulltag> impact </nulltag> on the Mission's funding for the year, this factor <nulltag> affects </nulltag> the variance explanation for air transportation described below. 
3. As a <nulltag> subsidiary </nulltag> organ of the United Nations <nulltag> acting </nulltag> through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), ITC has an <nulltag> organizational </nulltag> status distinct from that of most other Secretariat entities. 
The <nulltag> Commission </nulltag> on the Status of Women <nulltag> recommends </nulltag> to the Economic and Social Council the adoption of the <nulltag> following </nulltag> draft resolution: 
13. Also <nulltag> decides </nulltag> that each <nulltag> year </nulltag> the Commission will evaluate progress in the implementation of the <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> conclusions on a priority theme of a previous session, as its review theme, through an interactive dialogue that includes: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> he <nulltag> explains </nulltag> that the amount does not take into account the $10,816,000 owed by two closed peacekeeping missions with cash deficits as at 30 June 2014. 
57. The <nulltag> strategic </nulltag> <nulltag> documents </nulltag> for subregional offices <nulltag> outline </nulltag> functions that go beyond representational or liaison offices. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> survey respondents and interviewees <nulltag> underscored </nulltag> that the framework needed to be implemented and enforced. 
<nulltag> Increased </nulltag> <nulltag> awareness </nulltag> is the key to ensuring the <nulltag> financial </nulltag> and human resources necessary for States to fully realize the potential of such technology. 
<nulltag> Most </nulltag> recently the 20th <nulltag> session </nulltag> of the Conference of the Parties was <nulltag> held </nulltag> in December 2014 in Lima, Peru where the IAEA had an information booth and participated in a UN Side Event. 
This <nulltag> project </nulltag> <nulltag> seeks </nulltag> to support and enhance <nulltag> national </nulltag> programmes to build human resource capacity in cancer control and involves six African countries. 
My <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Envoy </nulltag> and UNHCR <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to work together to seek durable solutions for the residents through consular and humanitarian channels. 
I <nulltag> expect </nulltag> that <nulltag> crimes </nulltag> will be duly investigated so that their perpetrators can be held <nulltag> accountable </nulltag> and justice established. 
23. <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the communiqué of the African Union Peace and Security Council Summit on <nulltag> countering </nulltag> violent extremism and <nulltag> terrorism, </nulltag> held in Nairobi on 2 September 2014, and calls on United Nations counter-terrorism entities, within existing mandates, and Member States to provide assistance and capacity-building towards Africa's efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism; 
38. <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the African Union policy framework on security sector reform <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union at its summit in January 2013, welcomes the support rendered by the United Nations and development partners in the formulation of the policy framework, and calls upon the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community, including the United Nations system, to continue to support the efforts towards its implementation; 
9. I <nulltag> invite </nulltag> the <nulltag> men </nulltag> and women of the media to regroup and to do their work in <nulltag> strict </nulltag> compliance with their professional code of ethics. 
As a <nulltag> result </nulltag> of this <nulltag> continued </nulltag> weakness, the <nulltag> investment-to-GDP </nulltag> ratio is about 2.5 percentage points below the average of the pre-crisis period of 1998-2007. 
<nulltag> Advanced </nulltag> <nulltag> economies </nulltag> <nulltag> include </nulltag> North America, composed of Canada and the United States of America; the countries that are part of the eurozone; and other advanced European economies. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Decides </nulltag> to <nulltag> extend </nulltag> until 31 March 2016 the authorizations provided by and the measures imposed by resolution 2146 (2014); 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> We <nulltag> invite: </nulltag> 
25. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> <nulltag> reaffirms </nulltag> the <nulltag> unequivocal </nulltag> undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under Article VI, and affirms the importance of achieving and maintaining a world without nuclear weapons. 
20. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> recognizes and <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the steps taken to implement the Treaty between the <nulltag> Russian </nulltag> Federation and the United States of America on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, and the significant reductions in deployed and non-deployed nuclear weapons, including their declaration of dismantling nuclear weapon delivery vehicles. 
36. <nulltag> Speak-up </nulltag> <nulltag> culture </nulltag> <nulltag> enables </nulltag> the organization to address unethical conduct early enough so that it does not become an organizational risk. 
14. <nulltag> Sections </nulltag> 5 and 6 also <nulltag> apply </nulltag> to conduct when committed by a person, whether or not in Australia and whether or not an Australian citizen, using the services of an Australian ship or aircraft <nulltag> (by </nulltag> reference in those sections to the application of section 15.1 of the Criminal Code 1995). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 2204 (2015) <nulltag> renews </nulltag> those measures until 26 February 2016. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Synergies </nulltag> between programmes are potentially of <nulltag> prime </nulltag> importance. 
The <nulltag> secretariat </nulltag> is <nulltag> developing </nulltag> a <nulltag> financial </nulltag> reporting scheme to reflect all resources mobilized by the programmes and their partners, including in-kind contributions. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> to 1,800 United Nations Volunteers through <nulltag> local </nulltag> payroll 
<nulltag> Asymmetric </nulltag> threats, <nulltag> including </nulltag> <nulltag> targeted </nulltag> attacks against peacekeepers, harsh geographical conditions, insufficient resources and logistical constraints pose additional challenges. 
2. During its <nulltag> consideration </nulltag> of the financing of UNSOA, the Advisory Committee <nulltag> met </nulltag> with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided <nulltag> additional </nulltag> information and clarification, concluding with written responses received on 21 April 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Mandate and <nulltag> planned </nulltag> results 
A <nulltag> draft </nulltag> multilateral treaty is being <nulltag> developed </nulltag> on cooperation in preventing <nulltag> illicit </nulltag> trafficking of nuclear materials and combating nuclear terrorism in the Central Asian region. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Agenda 
<nulltag> Progress </nulltag> on <nulltag> moving </nulltag> <nulltag> over-the-counter </nulltag> derivatives trading onto exchanges remains slow and beset by differences of opinion between regulators in different jurisdictions. 
The <nulltag> first </nulltag> is the third <nulltag> International </nulltag> Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July, where a compact for a <nulltag> renewed </nulltag> global partnership could be realized. 
9. <nulltag> Looks </nulltag> forward to the results of the <nulltag> pilot </nulltag> implementation of the enterprise risk management system at the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and <nulltag> emphasizes </nulltag> the importance of identifying and sharing lessons learned and best practices with regard to its implementation with other field missions during the phased implementation at those missions; 
8. At the 9th <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> on 22 April 2015, delegations <nulltag> exchanged </nulltag> views and made <nulltag> various </nulltag> proposals on the Chair's revised non-paper dated 21 April 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Nations Operation in Burundi 
3. <nulltag> Moving </nulltag> from <nulltag> commitments </nulltag> to results: transforming <nulltag> public </nulltag> institutions to facilitate inclusive policy formulation and integration in the implementation and monitoring of the sustainable development goals: 
This could be <nulltag> followed </nulltag> by <nulltag> preparation </nulltag> of a report for consideration by the national parliament covering such issues as information requirements, <nulltag> global </nulltag> and national relevance of the goals and targets, a national action framework and possible inter-ministerial or intergovernmental cooperation mechanisms. 
Further <nulltag> analysed </nulltag> in the accompanying <nulltag> data </nulltag> companion are trends in progress and performance against <nulltag> key </nulltag> indicators, in the context of the Strategic Plan as well as the Millennium Development Goals and commitments of the Millennium Declaration. 
<nulltag> Other </nulltag> <nulltag> matters </nulltag> and adoption of draft decisions 
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation <nulltag> recalls </nulltag> that the attempted coup d'état was the culmination of the <nulltag> illegal </nulltag> and violent demonstrations that began in Bujumbura on 26 April 2015 at the behest of certain civil society officials and some opposition leaders. 
That has been <nulltag> covered, </nulltag> to some <nulltag> extent, </nulltag> by <nulltag> recent </nulltag> OIOS-Internal Audit Division audits pertaining to the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the regional commissions. 
<nulltag> According </nulltag> to the <nulltag> Inter-agency </nulltag> and Expert Group, "global targets were incorrectly interpreted as <nulltag> national, </nulltag> even sub-national targets, which distorted analysis, priority-setting and statistical development efforts in many countries". 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> spending containment measures should <nulltag> take </nulltag> into account the need to protect investment and avoid <nulltag> vicious </nulltag> circles whereby fiscal overadjustments strangle growth and tax revenues, ultimately widening the deficit and increasing the public debt burden. 
The <nulltag> net </nulltag> <nulltag> flow </nulltag> of financial resources into the region was more than enough to <nulltag> cover </nulltag> the balance-of-payments current account deficit, and the stock of international reserves of the region overall expanded by about 3 per cent. 
<nulltag> Total </nulltag> <nulltag> number </nulltag> of shots -- 54,379 
We greatly <nulltag> appreciate </nulltag> the <nulltag> courage </nulltag> of the peoples of Europe and across the world who, alongside <nulltag> us, </nulltag> opposed Nazism, and we remember the contribution and help of our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition in the achievement of our common victory. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 16 October 
It has also <nulltag> stated </nulltag> that it supports any <nulltag> genuine </nulltag> international effort aimed at countering the <nulltag> scourge </nulltag> of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, provided that, in doing so, every effort is made to safeguard civilian lives, respect national sovereignty and adhere to international instruments. 
<nulltag> Currently, </nulltag> efforts are being <nulltag> made </nulltag> to expand <nulltag> institutional </nulltag> coordination in the AIMS region through discussions between the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) and UNDP, inter alia. 
<nulltag> Resource </nulltag> requirements <nulltag> (before </nulltag> <nulltag> recosting): </nulltag> $3,747,800 
6. The <nulltag> Arab </nulltag> <nulltag> States </nulltag> <nulltag> affirm </nulltag> the importance of the right of each State to make choices and decisions on the peaceful use of nuclear energy without prejudice to its policies or the agreements and arrangements which it concludes in the scope of international cooperation programmes concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and without prejudice to its nuclear fuel cycle policy. 
The <nulltag> decline </nulltag> in the prices of oil and other commodities <nulltag> contributed </nulltag> to that process, leading to lower deficits in <nulltag> several </nulltag> large commodity importers and smaller surpluses or even deficits in major commodity exporters, notably Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries. 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> <nulltag> weak </nulltag> growth in wages and labour income will <nulltag> fail </nulltag> to make up for the higher price level, and private consumption is expected to further recede slightly in 2015 before resuming growth in 2016. 
In this <nulltag> vein, </nulltag> Brazil has actively <nulltag> supported </nulltag> proposals of <nulltag> several </nulltag> of the presidencies of the Conference on possible programmes of work. 
The <nulltag> critical </nulltag> <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, <nulltag> including </nulltag> East Jerusalem -- the territory constituting the State of Palestine -- continues to deteriorate as illegal and punitive measures by Israel, the occupying Power, against the Palestinian people continue apace. 
<nulltag> Stronger </nulltag> and more effective <nulltag> partnerships </nulltag> around issues, such as health, energy and water, or around groups, such as youth, women and indigenous peoples, among others, can be anticipated. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
These <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> <nulltag> groups </nulltag> have been the main beneficiaries, <nulltag> gaining </nulltag> a strategic foothold in Yemen aided by the foreign aerial campaign. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Ceasefire </nulltag> and an <nulltag> immediate </nulltag> end to all foreign military attacks; 
<nulltag> Owing </nulltag> to the <nulltag> diversity </nulltag> of Pacific countries and territories, there are <nulltag> significant </nulltag> variations in the social, political and economic situation of indigenous peoples in the region. 
14. <nulltag> Recalls </nulltag> <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> 28 of the report of the Advisory Committee, requests the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to ensure transparency in conducting the activities of the Vendor Review Committee, and looks forward to continued reporting on the activities of that Committee in his future reports; 
18A.54 The <nulltag> distribution </nulltag> of resources for <nulltag> executive </nulltag> direction and management is <nulltag> reflected </nulltag> in table 18A.9. 
<nulltag> Resource </nulltag> requirements <nulltag> (before </nulltag> <nulltag> recosting): </nulltag> $962,000 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> principles </nulltag> of governance of <nulltag> forest </nulltag> landscapes apply equally to the governance of biodiversity conservation. 
This is mainly <nulltag> due </nulltag> to unaddressed <nulltag> spending </nulltag> problems from the past and a lack of willingness to <nulltag> advance </nulltag> structural reforms. 
Despite the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> <nulltag> efficiency </nulltag> of the Governing Board, the Republika Srpska members <nulltag> remained </nulltag> opposed to regular adjustments of indirect tax revenue allocation coefficients as well as to the indirect tax revenue settlements for the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2014, for which the Republika Srpska owes the Federation approximately Euro21 million. 
6. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum <nulltag> calls </nulltag> upon States Members of the United Nations to recognize <nulltag> indigenous </nulltag> peoples, where they exist, consistent with the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in their legislation in order to gather statistical data thereon, especially in the area of allocation of land and other natural resources for traditional use. 
1. In <nulltag> establishing </nulltag> indicators, the <nulltag> focus </nulltag> should be on the vision and world view of <nulltag> indigenous </nulltag> peoples, based on collective rights, such as those to identity, land, territory, traditional knowledge, free, prior and informed consent and women's participation in local, national and international decision-making processes. 
<nulltag> Variance </nulltag> is <nulltag> owing </nulltag> to reduced number of United Nations Volunteers assigned during the <nulltag> first </nulltag> half of the year. 
I would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to thank the <nulltag> transitional </nulltag> <nulltag> authorities </nulltag> of the Central African Republic for their warm welcome, Mr. Gaye, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and his Office for all their assistance and continued support, as well as the Peacebuilding Support Office for its timely and substantive advice and support. 
<nulltag> English </nulltag> <nulltag> language </nulltag> training classes were regularly <nulltag> organized </nulltag> for Darfur police personnel to enable them to interact with the United Nations country team, especially the humanitarian component, which receives escorts from the Darfur police in delivering relief materials. 
65. While <nulltag> UNAMID, </nulltag> in collaboration with Government authorities and other stakeholders, has <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to support the mediation of <nulltag> intercommunal </nulltag> conflicts, relapses in existing conflicts and fresh outbreaks have continued, leading to increased protection needs for the vulnerable population. 
3. <nulltag> Reaffirms </nulltag> its commitment to the <nulltag> full </nulltag> implementation of the political declaration on Africa's development needs,2 as <nulltag> reaffirmed </nulltag> in the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development, adopted as the outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, held in Doha from 29 November to 2 December 2008;

More <nulltag> research </nulltag> to <nulltag> assist </nulltag> policymakers in addressing the causes and consequences of <nulltag> armed </nulltag> violence is required. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> use </nulltag> of <nulltag> improvised </nulltag> explosive devices by terrorist and other armed groups is on the rise. 
<nulltag> Section </nulltag> 166 <nulltag> contains </nulltag> the objective and <nulltag> subjective </nulltag> elements of the money-laundering offence as required under the Convention. 
<nulltag> Conditions </nulltag> on release <nulltag> pending </nulltag> trial are designed to ensure the presence of the defendant at the <nulltag> criminal </nulltag> proceedings (r.46, Rules of Criminal Procedure). 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> addendum </nulltag> <nulltag> lists </nulltag> the items on which the Security Council took action during the week ending 25 April 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> mandate </nulltag> of UNMIS was <nulltag> established </nulltag> by the Security Council in its resolution 1590 (2005).

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Consideration </nulltag> of the submission <nulltag> made </nulltag> by Argentina. 
We also <nulltag> call </nulltag> for the <nulltag> full </nulltag> <nulltag> implementation </nulltag> of relevant resolutions, keeping in mind the rules of procedure, including rule 141, while acknowledging existing relevant General Assembly practices. 
The <nulltag> upward </nulltag> <nulltag> shift </nulltag> in the price of housing-related items in GCC countries is <nulltag> expected </nulltag> to taper off, lowering consumer price inflation in those countries moderately. 
Among <nulltag> GCC </nulltag> countries, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are <nulltag> projected </nulltag> to grow above the <nulltag> subregional </nulltag> average. 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> <nulltag> evaluation </nulltag> <nulltag> focuses </nulltag> on the UNCTAD secretariat (hereafter referred to as UNCTAD). 
In this <nulltag> group, </nulltag> 87.1 per cent agree strongly or somewhat that UNCTAD delivers <nulltag> clear </nulltag> value-add <nulltag> compared </nulltag> with other actors producing similar work. 
5. <nulltag> Affirms </nulltag> that <nulltag> attacks </nulltag> intentionally directed against buildings dedicated to religion, <nulltag> education, </nulltag> art, science or charitable purposes, or historic monuments, may amount to war crimes;

He will <nulltag> build </nulltag> on the <nulltag> achievements </nulltag> of his predecessor and on the <nulltag> regional </nulltag> and international efforts of the United Nations. 
The <nulltag> Mechanism </nulltag> <nulltag> continues </nulltag> to monitor for any change of status in this <nulltag> referred </nulltag> case. 
<nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Katsuhisa Furukawa, <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> issues <nulltag> (Japan) </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> technical </nulltag> focal point for the management response to the formative evaluation: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> following </nulltag> two <nulltag> reports </nulltag> will be presented: (a) report of the field visit to the UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, Bangkok, and to Malaysia, by Members of the Bureau of the Executive Board, from 27 March to 3 April 2015, and (b) report of the field visit of the Executive Board of UNICEF to Madagascar, from 13 to 17 April 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Mr. Matthias Dettling (Switzerland) 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) missions <nulltag> use </nulltag> the IAEA recommendations as reference for their security review. 
31. During the <nulltag> NSS </nulltag> 2014, the Netherlands, in <nulltag> close </nulltag> cooperation with the United States of America and the Republic of Korea, <nulltag> launched </nulltag> an initiative to strengthen implementation of the IAEA recommendations contained in Nuclear Security Series 13, 14 and 15. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Comprehensive <nulltag> self-assessment </nulltag> checklist 
The <nulltag> Agency </nulltag> should also <nulltag> exercise </nulltag> <nulltag> utmost </nulltag> transparency and balance and secure the consent of IAEA member States in developing and implementing the concept. 
That will <nulltag> enable </nulltag> <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> to play its <nulltag> expected </nulltag> role in effectively verifying a future nuclear weapons convention, or a fissile material cut-off treaty, covering all existing nuclear activities and stockpiles. 
20. Also <nulltag> decides </nulltag> to apportion among <nulltag> Member </nulltag> States the amount of _ dollars for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2016 at a <nulltag> monthly </nulltag> rate of _ dollars, in accordance with the scale of assessments for 2016 and the updated levels, subject to a decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force; 
<nulltag> International </nulltag> Financial Reporting Standard 6 also <nulltag> provides </nulltag> a <nulltag> nonexhaustive </nulltag> list of examples of expenditure that might be presented in the initial measurement of exploration and evaluation assets. 
5. The <nulltag> second </nulltag> <nulltag> reason </nulltag> for <nulltag> requiring </nulltag> financial reports is potentially of direct benefit to the contractor. 
<nulltag> Background </nulltag> information on the <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> candidate is provided in the annex to the <nulltag> present </nulltag> document. 
<nulltag> Reaffirming </nulltag> the <nulltag> role </nulltag> of the United Nations System Staff College as an institution for <nulltag> system-wide </nulltag> knowledge management, training and continuous learning for the staff of the United Nations system, in particular in the areas of economic and social development, peace and security and internal management, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Central </nulltag> and Eastern European States: [to be <nulltag> completed] </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Western </nulltag> European and other <nulltag> States: </nulltag> [to be completed] 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> considered the <nulltag> report </nulltag> of the Disarmament Commission,

<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> time </nulltag> of the incident, most had <nulltag> done </nulltag> so, but up to 300 people remained. 
10. Specifically with <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to United Nations premises, the Government <nulltag> stated </nulltag> that it had routinely updated the location of all such premises on the IDF command and control system and coordination maps and had issued <nulltag> special </nulltag> and restrictive rules for engaging targets that would affect them. 
This <nulltag> threat </nulltag> <nulltag> persists </nulltag> and the attacks by ISIL from <nulltag> safe </nulltag> havens in Syria continue. 
55. <nulltag> Palestinian </nulltag> <nulltag> farmers </nulltag> are <nulltag> obliged </nulltag> to obtain special permits to access their farming "seam zone", which has been declared a "closed area". 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Since 2007, <nulltag> Israel </nulltag> has <nulltag> treated </nulltag> Palestinians originating from Gaza and living in the West Bank as "illegal stayers", unless they hold a permit issued by the military. 
The law <nulltag> established </nulltag> on a <nulltag> customary </nulltag> <nulltag> basis </nulltag> between States, added to long practice, resulted in rules differing from those of general international law existing in treaties. 
A <nulltag> similar </nulltag> <nulltag> practice </nulltag> was <nulltag> followed </nulltag> in the cases of succession in the International Monetary Fund membership of the members of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> of Experts is <nulltag> invited </nulltag> to take note of the report and to express its views on the development of a set of <nulltag> global </nulltag> fundamental geospatial data themes that would initially serve the needs of the sustainable development agenda. 
200. The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> appreciates </nulltag> the ongoing efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support to implement the Guidelines on Integrating a Gender Perspective into the Work of the United Nations Military in Peacekeeping Operations, in accordance with the implementation strategy, including through the existing gender advisers and the designation of military gender advisers and an associate expert on gender in the Office of Military Affairs. 
The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> the Secretariat to ensure cohesion in the capability-driven approach and to support different initiatives, including the agreed use of modern technology consistent with the basic principles of peacekeeping, to enhance, among other things, situational awareness and force protection.

Since 2006, <nulltag> Department </nulltag> of Budget and Management guidelines and procedures <nulltag> related </nulltag> to the preparation of <nulltag> national </nulltag> and local budgets have emphasized funding for Millennium Development Goals-related programmes, activities and projects.

This <nulltag> cannot </nulltag> be <nulltag> achieved </nulltag> without either <nulltag> effective </nulltag> dissemination of key messages or adequate promotion of the HDR by UNDP. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> and conclusions 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Summit </nulltag> <nulltag> directed </nulltag> the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the East African Community partner States and of South Africa to urgently communicate these and other decisions to the Government of Burundi. 
8. The <nulltag> Summit </nulltag> <nulltag> welcomed </nulltag> the return to <nulltag> constitutional </nulltag> order in Burundi after the attempted coup d'état of 13 May 2015. 
17. <nulltag> UNOPS </nulltag> <nulltag> provides </nulltag> online ethics training via the online learning <nulltag> programme </nulltag> Integrity Awareness Initiative, which is directed at personnel at all levels and focuses on core values and standards of integrity to be observed in the workplace. 
After this <nulltag> workplan, </nulltag> an <nulltag> overall </nulltag> summary <nulltag> report, </nulltag> bringing together all the results of the technical and economic studies, will be prepared. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> At the <nulltag> current </nulltag> <nulltag> stage </nulltag> of exploration, there are still uncertainties about both the geometry of the palaeochannels and the geomechanical properties of their formation. 
Through their <nulltag> expertise, </nulltag> <nulltag> experience </nulltag> and political standing, the group is <nulltag> tasked </nulltag> with supporting and complementing efforts to promote the Treaty's entry into force as well as reinvigorating international endeavours to achieve this goal. 
36. <nulltag> Appreciates </nulltag> the <nulltag> work </nulltag> of the Paris Pact initiative and its <nulltag> "Paris-Moscow" </nulltag> process in countering the production, trafficking and consumption of opium and heroin from Afghanistan and the elimination of poppy crops, drug laboratories and stores as well as the interception of drug convoys, underlines the importance of border management cooperation, and welcomes the intensified cooperation of the relevant United Nations institutions with the OSCE and the CSTO in this regard; 
100. The <nulltag> Secretary-General's </nulltag> <nulltag> report </nulltag> <nulltag> indicates </nulltag> that the Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights provides support to the peacekeeping operations mainly through its Peace Mission Support Section and the three geographical branches (the Africa Branch, the Asia-Pacific and Middle East and North Africa Branch and the Americas, Europe and Central Asia Branch). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was also <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that, depending on the outcome of the classification, the existing level of a post could be confirmed or changed upward or downward. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the highly <nulltag> successful </nulltag> 1993 U.S.-Russia <nulltag> HEU </nulltag> Purchase Agreement, 500 metric tons of Russian weapons-origin HEU, which is equivalent to roughly 20,000 nuclear warheads, has been down-blended into LEU for use in U.S. nuclear power plants. 
Our report to the 2015 <nulltag> RevCon </nulltag> <nulltag> shows </nulltag> the stockpile has now been reduced to 4,717 warheads with an <nulltag> additional </nulltag> 87 warheads removed from the stockpile since our report to the 2014 NPT Preparatory Committee meeting. 
It <nulltag> found </nulltag> that <nulltag> Equatorial </nulltag> Guinea continued to heavily rely on the hydrocarbon sector and had a <nulltag> significant </nulltag> imbalance between the high level of per capita income and the low level of its human assets index. 
<nulltag> Concurrently, </nulltag> the generation of <nulltag> non-oil </nulltag> revenues <nulltag> remains </nulltag> at lower levels than foreseen in the current budget, while the rising cost of the ongoing conflict continued to skew Government expenditure towards security, at the expense of funding for other sectors. 
The <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> Statute <nulltag> contains </nulltag> the objective of accelerating and enlarging <nulltag> "the </nulltag> contribution of atomic energy to peace, health, and prosperity throughout the world." 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States has fully <nulltag> supported </nulltag> each of these measures, and will continue to consider <nulltag> additional </nulltag> multilateral measures to ensure reliable access to nuclear fuel, an objective of Action 58 in the 2010 NPT Action Plan. 
2. <nulltag> Reaffirm </nulltag> the mutually <nulltag> reinforcing </nulltag> relationship between nuclear disarmament and nuclear <nulltag> non-proliferation, </nulltag> both vertical and horizontal, confirming that progress on nuclear non-proliferation remains unsustainable without parallel progress in nuclear disarmament. 
3. The <nulltag> resolution </nulltag> on the Middle East and the decision <nulltag> entitled </nulltag> "Principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament", adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference as part of the <nulltag> indefinite </nulltag> extension package, highlighted the essential foundation that the goals of universality and nuclear disarmament represent for the indefinitely extended Treaty, its effectiveness and credibility. 
On <nulltag> behalf </nulltag> of the people of Syria and the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, it is with <nulltag> great </nulltag> alarm that I <nulltag> draw </nulltag> your attention to the humanitarian disaster currently unfolding in the Yarmouk refugee camp. 
In that same <nulltag> decision, </nulltag> the Conference of the Parties also decided to evaluate the <nulltag> effectiveness </nulltag> of the implementation of the memorandum of understanding between the Conference of the Parties and the Council of the Global Environment Facility at the <nulltag> eighth </nulltag> meeting of the Conference of the Parties and every two years thereafter. 
Further <nulltag> condemning </nulltag> <nulltag> harassment </nulltag> and targeting of <nulltag> civil </nulltag> society, humanitarian personnel and journalists, and emphasizing that those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights must be held accountable and that the Government of South Sudan bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including from potential crimes against humanity and war crimes, 
<nulltag> Underscoring </nulltag> its <nulltag> grave </nulltag> alarm and concern regarding the worsening political, security, and <nulltag> humanitarian </nulltag> crisis in South Sudan resulting from the internal Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) political dispute and subsequent violence caused by the country's political and military leaders, 
The <nulltag> daily </nulltag> <nulltag> grind </nulltag> of the urgent, he noted, <nulltag> tended </nulltag> to leave little time for those matters that in the long run could be even more important to the long-term credibility of the institution. 
Upon <nulltag> instructions </nulltag> from my Government, I have the honour to <nulltag> bring </nulltag> to your attention the <nulltag> joint </nulltag> military exercises of the United States and south Korea, entitled "Key Resolve" and "Foal Eagle", which have been conducted against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) during the months of March and April 2015. 
19. I <nulltag> ask </nulltag> the <nulltag> men </nulltag> and women working in the media, especially the <nulltag> foreign </nulltag> media, to focus on that aspect of the issue and to portray Burundi in a positive light, as the country is larger than just the four districts I have mentioned. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> I also <nulltag> request </nulltag> the <nulltag> countries </nulltag> that have welcomed them to facilitate the return of all those who wish to come home. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> resolution I

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the <nulltag> preparatory </nulltag> committee on the Second World Assembly on Ageing; 
They <nulltag> included </nulltag> a <nulltag> short-term </nulltag> <nulltag> planning </nulltag> and funding cycle, the lack of development-related staff skills, structures and competencies and limited solutions-focused partnerships and partner agreements, including joint programming with the United Nations country team. 
As <nulltag> observed </nulltag> by <nulltag> OIOS </nulltag> on site <nulltag> visits, </nulltag> employment opportunities for refugees appear largely restricted to camp settings or the informal sector. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> is like other organizations in this regard and has <nulltag> worked </nulltag> consciously and consistently since its foundation to maximize the potential of its mandate and staff members and to build synergies across its programmes.

19.19 <nulltag> Changes </nulltag> in the distribution of resources are the result of a realignment of <nulltag> non-post </nulltag> resources to accurately <nulltag> reflect </nulltag> where the costs are actually incurred. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> of Experts <nulltag> endorsed </nulltag> the terms of reference of the Expert Group, including its programme of work and areas of focus, and took note of the suggestions from Member States regarding the need to consider <nulltag> big </nulltag> data, the 2020 round of censuses and other information as means of integration, while avoiding duplication of efforts. 
The <nulltag> village </nulltag> of Chaqra is <nulltag> home </nulltag> to 4,000 people and 400 <nulltag> military </nulltag> sites installed by Hizbullah. 
The <nulltag> supplies </nulltag> are <nulltag> changed </nulltag> every five months before they are <nulltag> outdated. </nulltag> 
If the <nulltag> Jordanian </nulltag> <nulltag> regime </nulltag> truly <nulltag> wished </nulltag> to maintain Syria's stability, safeguard the lives of Syrian civilians and eradicate the blight of terrorism, it would not have established training camps for terrorists in its territory, set up logistical operations centres to support and guide terrorist groups, or helped thousands of terrorists cross its borders on a daily basis to infiltrate Syria. 
It also <nulltag> provides </nulltag> <nulltag> guidance </nulltag> and support for both <nulltag> central </nulltag> and decentralized evaluation, drawing on good practices within UN-Women and elsewhere and the United Nations Evaluation Group guidelines. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of <nulltag> expert </nulltag> group meeting on preparation for the World Survey on the Role of Women in Development 
<nulltag> Given </nulltag> the <nulltag> paramount </nulltag> importance of the issue of <nulltag> Palestinian </nulltag> political prisoners, the Committee also promoted an in-depth analysis of the status of these prisoners in accordance with international law, examining the issue in the context of the peace process, and identified practical steps to promote a solution. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> UNMIK </nulltag> also <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to facilitate communications between the Kosovo authorities and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and its member countries. 
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> looks </nulltag> forward to receiving <nulltag> updated </nulltag> information in that regard in the context of the Board's next report on peacekeeping operations. 
In that <nulltag> connection, </nulltag> the Board notes that the <nulltag> financial </nulltag> <nulltag> statements </nulltag> for the year ended 30 June 2014, submitted to the Board on 30 September 2014, contained significant errors that were detected during the course of the Board's audit.

41. <nulltag> UN-Habitat </nulltag> <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to work in close <nulltag> collaboration </nulltag> with the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 
83. The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Rapporteur </nulltag> on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and the right to non-discrimination in this context <nulltag> collaborated </nulltag> with UN-Habitat on promoting the responsibilities of Governments with respect to the right to adequate housing. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> and meetings of the <nulltag> working </nulltag> groups 
2. <nulltag> Reiterates </nulltag> that the illicit transfer, <nulltag> destabilizing </nulltag> accumulation and misuse of <nulltag> small </nulltag> arms and light weapons fuel conflict and have devastating impact on the protection of civilians, reiterates its demand that all parties to armed conflict comply strictly with the obligations applicable to them under international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international refugee law, and stresses the need for parties to take all required measures to avoid civilian casualties, respect and protect the civilian population; 
20. <nulltag> Recognizes </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of preventing the illicit transfers and sales of weapons and <nulltag> ammunition, </nulltag> including small arms and light weapons, to armed groups and criminal networks that target civilians and civilian objects and underlines that such transfers could exacerbate conflict or facilitate the commitment of serious violations of international humanitarian law and serious violations and abuses of human rights; 
Knowingly and with <nulltag> impunity, </nulltag> <nulltag> Russia </nulltag> <nulltag> continues </nulltag> violating human rights in the occupied territory, terrorizing those who disagree, especially Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, conducting detentions and searches, chasing and detaining civic activists and waging a whole war against independent media and journalists. 
The <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> that all parties should take <nulltag> concrete </nulltag> steps to agree and implement a consensus-based political solution to Yemen's crisis in accordance with the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the comprehensive National Dialogue conference, and the Peace and National Partnership Agreement and its security annex. 
<nulltag> Meanwhile, </nulltag> it is <nulltag> obvious </nulltag> that the territorial integrity as well as the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran over the <nulltag> said </nulltag> islands are not negotiable. 
In safeguards, the <nulltag> United </nulltag> States has <nulltag> held </nulltag> and supported <nulltag> national, </nulltag> regional and international training courses on State Systems of Accounting for and Control of Nuclear Material and the Additional Protocol. 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States <nulltag> maintains </nulltag> a <nulltag> rigorous </nulltag> and comprehensive system of export controls for nuclear and nuclear-related dual-use items and technology, consistent with these guidelines control lists, and based in U.S. law and regulations. 
We <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> our <nulltag> leading </nulltag> <nulltag> role </nulltag> and responsibility at all levels in developing and implementing crime prevention strategies and criminal justice policies at the national and subnational levels. 
5. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> the <nulltag> generous </nulltag> <nulltag> offer </nulltag> of the Government of Peru to host the first meeting of the Conference; 
Whereas the <nulltag> proposals </nulltag> <nulltag> put </nulltag> forward were mutually exclusive, as the parties on one side proposed to have the President of the Republic elected by the National Assembly and the Senate, and this proposal was challenged by the proponents of election by <nulltag> direct </nulltag> universal suffrage, which would give the President so elected a strong mandate from the people and broad legitimacy; 
<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> the <nulltag> important </nulltag> <nulltag> role </nulltag> to be performed by the Peacebuilding Commission towards recovery, reintegration and reconstruction in countries emerging from conflict, particularly in Africa,

<nulltag>  </nulltag> that <nulltag> condone </nulltag> such violence often predate the armed conflicts, yet are reinforced during the conflicts and often persist long after the cessation of hostilities. 
13. The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> notes that the opening, in 2014, of the Regional Office of UNWomen for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in Istanbul, Turkey, <nulltag> completed </nulltag> the implementation of the <nulltag> regional </nulltag> architecture of UN-Women. 
A <nulltag> strong </nulltag> <nulltag> focus </nulltag> on high-impact initiatives will <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> that the proposed growth will likewise be driven by and responsive to the Entity's mandate and strategic plan. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Fifth </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> resumed </nulltag> its consideration of the item at its 29th and 34th meetings, on 4 and 27 March 2015. 
<nulltag> Affirming </nulltag> that the <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> of the United Nations in the <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> settlement of disputes, including through its peacekeeping operations, are indispensable, 
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee further <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> the need for <nulltag> cost-effective </nulltag> solutions that maximize savings. 
The <nulltag> relevant </nulltag> <nulltag> paragraphs </nulltag> of the draft procedures and criteria (paras. 4-6) are <nulltag> reproduced </nulltag> in annex I to the present note. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> concluding observations on each of the reports considered. 
20. The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> also <nulltag> sent </nulltag> <nulltag> first </nulltag> reminders to the following States parties whose follow-up reports were overdue: Guyana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Mexico and Samoa. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> between Iran and Iraq (26 September 1980; 31 January 1991). 
<nulltag> Important </nulltag> <nulltag> lessons </nulltag> have been <nulltag> learned </nulltag> from the recent transitions of operations from the African Union to the United Nations in the Central African Republic and Mali, which should be applied to future transitions. 
The component will be <nulltag> implemented </nulltag> in <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with the strategy detailed under component 4, Services to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, of subprogramme 1, Management services, administration of justice and services to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, of programme 25, part A, Management and support services, of the <nulltag> biennial </nulltag> programme plan for the period 2016-2017. 
<nulltag> c. </nulltag> <nulltag> Corrosion </nulltag> of metals <nulltag> (pitting </nulltag> corrosion and suitability of tests C.1 for solids); 
48. The <nulltag> Subcommittee </nulltag> <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to cooperate with treaty bodies established under <nulltag> international </nulltag> conventions concerning chemical safety to promote the implementation of the Globally Harmonized System through such conventions (see also para. 27 above). 
<nulltag> Reassignment </nulltag> of 1 <nulltag> Administrative </nulltag> Assistant post from the Liaison Office in El Muglad to a HVAC Technician post <nulltag> located </nulltag> in Abyei in the Engineering Section

<nulltag> Statement </nulltag> of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia <nulltag> regarding </nulltag> the death of <nulltag> 12-year-old </nulltag> Irakli Tsaava, a resident of the Russianoccupied Georgian region of Abkhazia 
The <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> <nulltag> reductions </nulltag> will not have an impact on the <nulltag> full </nulltag> and effective implementation of the mandate. 
The <nulltag> items </nulltag> <nulltag> involved </nulltag> were <nulltag> "spare </nulltag> parts for combat aircraft", which are covered by paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1929 (2010). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> II 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Other </nulltag> <nulltag> matters. </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> Falkland </nulltag> Islands (Malvinas) has a very <nulltag> low </nulltag> rate of unemployment, which was <nulltag> recorded </nulltag> as less than 1 per cent in 2012, with almost 20 per cent of those employed having more than one job. 
13. The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> will <nulltag> request </nulltag> the Executive Directorate, in <nulltag> close </nulltag> cooperation with relevant entities of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, to hold periodic briefings for Member States on thematic or regional aspects of the implementation of resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), taking into account the new requirements set out in resolution 2178 (2014). 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was <nulltag> informed, </nulltag> however, that there was clear evidence to <nulltag> suggest </nulltag> that, if specific inflationary costs were to be taken into account, the decrease in peacekeeping costs may in fact be higher in real terms than the 17 per cent reported in the current report of the Secretary-General. 
This <nulltag> initiative </nulltag> is <nulltag> supported </nulltag> with <nulltag> national </nulltag> teacher re-training across primary and secondary schools. 
As the <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> noted </nulltag> in 2014, the problem of terrorists travelling to <nulltag> foreign </nulltag> conflicts is not new, but the threat has become grave and is continuing, with an unprecedented flow of fighters and facilitation networks fuelling multiple conflicts worldwide, such as in Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Yemen and Libya. 
As for the <nulltag> repeated </nulltag> false <nulltag> allegations </nulltag> <nulltag> regarding </nulltag> the Ercan Airport in the North, it should once again be underlined that the technologically up-to-date Ercan Area Control Centre (ACC) and Airport in North Cyprus have been providing regular, reliable and safe air traffic services since the Greek Cypriot refusal in 1977 to provide air traffic services in the northern part of the island in line with its isolation policy that has been imposed on the Turkish Cypriot people. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> in the year 2014, about 25,000 planes used Ercan Airport for arrival and departure and 200,000 planes used Ercan Advisory Airspace. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> addresses </nulltag> this issue further in its report on <nulltag> cross-cutting </nulltag> issues related to peacekeeping operations. 
6. <nulltag> Calls </nulltag> upon Israel to <nulltag> facilitate </nulltag> the return of all refugees and <nulltag> displaced </nulltag> Palestinian women and children to their homes and properties, in compliance with the relevant United Nations resolutions; 
That <nulltag> commission </nulltag> shall <nulltag> work </nulltag> in <nulltag> close </nulltag> cooperation with the Monitoring Committee of the present Agreement. 
<nulltag> Having </nulltag> met in <nulltag> Algiers </nulltag> in the framework of the negotiation process set out in the road map, with a view to reaching an Agreement to bring about a <nulltag> comprehensive </nulltag> and lasting peace that will put a definitive end to the crisis in the northern regions of Mali, referred to by some as the Azawad, 
<nulltag> 25-26 </nulltag> <nulltag> March </nulltag> 
In the same <nulltag> resolution, </nulltag> the <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> requested the Secretariat, subject to the availability of <nulltag> extrabudgetary </nulltag> resources, to continue to perform the functions of an international observatory and, at the request of the Working Group or the Conference, to provide information on lessons learned and the adaptability of good practices, as well as related technical assistance activities, which could be offered to States parties upon request. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> were <nulltag> made </nulltag> by the Chair and the Acting High Representative for Disarmament Affairs. 
The <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> already <nulltag> plays </nulltag> a <nulltag> major </nulltag> role in this field and should be further supported. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Mission of the Republic of Lithuania to the United Nations <nulltag> presents </nulltag> its compliments to the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014) and has the honour to submit the report of Lithuania prepared pursuant to paragraph 9 of resolution 2204 (2015) (see annex). 
Those <nulltag> illegal </nulltag> <nulltag> practices </nulltag> are yet another entry in Israel's shameful record, which is replete with such crimes as <nulltag> sowing </nulltag> fear, terrorism, forced displacement, the razing of Syrian villages, the plundering of natural resources and the destruction of historical monuments and the environment. 
The <nulltag> first </nulltag> <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> of the technical <nulltag> working </nulltag> group held on 20 February brought together representatives of MINUSMA, the European Union, ECOWAS, the European Union training mission in Mali and the European Union police training mission. 
<nulltag> March </nulltag> <nulltag> marked </nulltag> yet another <nulltag> deadly </nulltag> month for the Syrian people. 
Prior to <nulltag> closure, </nulltag> the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> <nulltag> regime </nulltag> prevented several United Nations aid convoys from entering Eastern Ghouta through the Wafideen Camp crossing.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> Wi-Fi was also <nulltag> established </nulltag> in those logistics bases for the use of personnel other than that of UNMEER involved in the Ebola crisis response. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> For its <nulltag> consideration </nulltag> of the item, the Committee had before it the <nulltag> following </nulltag> documents: 
8. <nulltag> Further </nulltag> <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the initiative of the Unit of establishing a roster of <nulltag> potential </nulltag> topics for its programme of work for the biennium 2016-2017;

<nulltag>  </nulltag> Decentralized evaluation system 
7437th <nulltag> (closed) </nulltag> <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> <nulltag> held </nulltag> on 5 May 2015. 
Some <nulltag> political </nulltag> and civil <nulltag> society </nulltag> sectors increasingly <nulltag> question </nulltag> the validity of plebiscites by whose results the Government of the United States is not bound, and also whether the United States is actually willing to extend statehood. 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States Navy has <nulltag> said </nulltag> that its forces accidentally fired 263 rounds of ammunition tipped with <nulltag> depleted </nulltag> uranium on the Vieques range in 1999, violating federal law. 
2. The <nulltag> facts-based </nulltag> <nulltag> discussions </nulltag> and expert presentations at these conferences <nulltag> generated </nulltag> strong interest in the international community and highly relevant input for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its key objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
These <nulltag> consequences </nulltag> can be <nulltag> large-scale </nulltag> and potentially <nulltag> irreversible; </nulltag> 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> a copy of a letter dated 30 March 2015 from the Secretary-General of the Frente Polisario, Mohamed Abdelaziz, on the situation concerning <nulltag> Western </nulltag> Sahara (see annex). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Joel Salek, finance (Colombia) 
The <nulltag> Houthis </nulltag> have <nulltag> insisted </nulltag> on repeatedly taking <nulltag> unilateral </nulltag> actions and using violence to achieve their political goals. 
<nulltag> Accordingly, </nulltag> since 26 March 2015, the objective of the coalition <nulltag> formed </nulltag> in response to that request has been to protect the people of Yemen from the violence targeted at them by the Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh and to support the <nulltag> legitimate </nulltag> President and Government of Yemen, while committing to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Yemen. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> decrease </nulltag> is <nulltag> attributable </nulltag> to a reduction in authorized strength as <nulltag> described </nulltag> in paragraph 26 (a) above. 
<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> that the <nulltag> decision </nulltag> to adopt the International Public Sector Accounting Standards will result in <nulltag> certain </nulltag> changes in accounting approaches, which will necessitate the revision of the Financial Rules of the Fund, 
<nulltag> Deleting </nulltag> <nulltag> rules </nulltag> that relate to amounts classified as <nulltag> miscellaneous </nulltag> income, since the current wording in the Financial Rules of the Fund is not consistent with IPSAS, whereas the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, which also govern UNEP, are consistent; 
<nulltag> Several </nulltag> <nulltag> speakers </nulltag> <nulltag> recalled </nulltag> the importance of international tax cooperation to enhance resource mobilization for structural transformation. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> There was a <nulltag> clear </nulltag> <nulltag> understanding </nulltag> of the process of structural transformation. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> At its 8th <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> on 22 April, the Working Group <nulltag> expressed </nulltag> its appreciation to the Chair and the Secretariat.

Accordingly, the <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> <nulltag> resource </nulltag> requirements under this section have been prepared on the basis of the established methodology, but taking into consideration the results of the <nulltag> strategic </nulltag> capital review. 
So too is the <nulltag> immediate </nulltag> <nulltag> need </nulltag> to <nulltag> improve </nulltag> analytical understanding of the problem and operational information and intelligence sharing within national Governments and between Member States, in particular by taking further steps to share watch list information on individuals of interest. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> reported </nulltag> <nulltag> payment </nulltag> of salaries by ISIL may be a financial incentive for some fighters. 
The <nulltag> Islamic </nulltag> Republic of Iran is of the view that no <nulltag> genuine </nulltag> non-proliferation measure can or should <nulltag> limit </nulltag> or suspend, partly or in full, any element of the inalienable right of all the parties under article IV of the Treaty, let alone use non-proliferation as a pretext to violate that right. 
14.

In addition, the <nulltag> progressive </nulltag> <nulltag> deployment </nulltag> of Umoja Foundation and Extension, <nulltag> including </nulltag> Umoja Extension to peacekeeping operations, will have a significant impact on the preparation of IPSAS-compliant financial statements for 2015 and 2016, which will be managed carefully.

<nulltag> Although, </nulltag> in accordance with the terms of reference, they could not <nulltag> defer </nulltag> their reviews, some of the 70 States whose reviews were scheduled for the <nulltag> fourth </nulltag> year had expressed their need to delay preparations for their reviews either because they were new States parties or because they wished to take advantage of being reviewing States first in order to gain experience.

3. <nulltag> Pledge </nulltag> to <nulltag> accelerate </nulltag> and intensify support for the <nulltag> popular </nulltag> resistance in Aden, Tai`zz and every part of Yemen, and to provide its members with weapons and logistical support, and assistance in organizing and coordinating their efforts. 
The <nulltag> creation </nulltag> of this zone <nulltag> constituted </nulltag> an <nulltag> important </nulltag> step towards promoting cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in the environmental rehabilitation of territories affected by radioactive contamination and pollution. 
The <nulltag> Federation </nulltag> <nulltag> participated </nulltag> in every session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women from 2010 to 2013 <nulltag> (fifty-fourth </nulltag> to fifty-seventh sessions). 
In <nulltag> order </nulltag> to <nulltag> achieve </nulltag> those aims, it organizes <nulltag> seminars, </nulltag> conferences and workshops; it conducts assessments and audits of programmes already carried out; and it publishes information about poverty, development and the culture of peace, among other activities. 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> South Africa has <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> domestic legislation, including the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, No 87 of 1993, and the Nuclear Energy Act, No. 46 of 1999, both of which provide domestic effect to South Africa's obligations under the NPT regarding the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the application of nuclear energy for exclusively <nulltag> peaceful </nulltag> purposes, aimed at the achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Africa <nulltag> implements </nulltag> its obligations under the Treaty through support for the IAEA's Technical Co-operation Programme (TCP). 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> efforts are being <nulltag> made </nulltag> to enhance trade connectivity, such as the <nulltag> Chinese-led </nulltag> initiative to set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 
The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Mission of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to the United Nations kindly <nulltag> requests </nulltag> the circulation of the <nulltag> present </nulltag> letter and its annex as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda items 68 (c) and 107, and of the Security Council (see annex).

27. In the <nulltag> Greater </nulltag> Horn of Africa, over 12.8 million people <nulltag> suffered </nulltag> from <nulltag> acute </nulltag> food insecurity, resulting from two consecutive poor rainy seasons, ongoing conflicts in Somalia, South Sudan and the Sudan and soaring food prices. 
<nulltag> Humanitarian </nulltag> <nulltag> access </nulltag> to people in need is a prerequisite for effective humanitarian action, <nulltag> including </nulltag> needs assessments, protection and the provision of assistance. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 5, 11 and 12 are <nulltag> directed </nulltag> to the Administrator for consideration. 
<nulltag> Please </nulltag> <nulltag> provide </nulltag> information on measures taken to ensure that <nulltag> conscientious </nulltag> objection by health-care providers does not undermine access by women, in particular rural women, adolescent girls, women with disabilities and Roma women, to safe and legal abortion and other reproductive health services. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> donors <nulltag> signalled </nulltag> that they would link their <nulltag> level </nulltag> of engagement with UN-Habitat with the governance issue, and cuts in financing were later linked by some donors to the issue. 
34.64 The <nulltag> amount </nulltag> of $2,322,100, <nulltag> reflecting </nulltag> a decrease of $137,500, would provide for the <nulltag> partial </nulltag> financing of 9 posts (1 P-5, 2 P-4, 2 P-3, 1 P-2 and 3 General Service (Other level)) for the crisis management capacity at Headquarters. 
3. To <nulltag> call </nulltag> on the <nulltag> international </nulltag> <nulltag> community </nulltag> to lift immediately and completely the blockade and all unilateral, coercive economic measures imposed on the Syrian people and its institutions. 
The <nulltag> practice </nulltag> of trading in <nulltag> old </nulltag> vehicles against the purchase price of new vehicles <nulltag> continues, </nulltag> which means that the benefit of resale value is achieved by net lower purchase prices. 
If <nulltag> available </nulltag> <nulltag> information </nulltag> cannot be <nulltag> shared </nulltag> immediately with front-line officers, it will be virtually impossible to identify potential foreign terrorist fighters before they have crossed the border into another State. 
The <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of a functioning refugee status determination system is an <nulltag> effective </nulltag> way to <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> refugees who require international protection and exclude those, such as terrorists, who are undeserving of such protection. 
The <nulltag> Office’s </nulltag> <nulltag> varied </nulltag> experiences are also <nulltag> beneficial </nulltag> to the investigation and prosecution of other transnational and complex crimes in post-conflict and transitional societies, including terrorism, organized crime and corruption. 
25.25 The <nulltag> provision </nulltag> of funds to UNHCR for the <nulltag> administrative </nulltag> expenditures of the Office of the High Commissioner in the form of a grant rather than as post and non-post resources was <nulltag> initiated </nulltag> in the biennium 2002-2003. 
<nulltag> Israel </nulltag> will not <nulltag> accept </nulltag> any attacks on its territory and it will exercise its right to self-defence and take all <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> measures to protect its population. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> threat </nulltag> to our region is very <nulltag> real. </nulltag> 
31. <nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Pereña <nulltag> remarked </nulltag> that the <nulltag> former </nulltag> Millennium Development Goals paradigm had been driven by the donor-recipient dichotomy and would no longer be applicable to yield results in the context of the post-2015 development agenda and the sustainable development goals. 
<nulltag> WTO </nulltag> will have the Fifth Global Review of Aid for Trade from 30 June to 2 July 2015 under the theme of <nulltag> "Reducing </nulltag> trade costs for <nulltag> inclusive, </nulltag> sustainable growth". 
18. From 28 to 30 <nulltag> April </nulltag> 2014, WHO and ILO <nulltag> convened </nulltag> an <nulltag> international </nulltag> consultation in Semnan, Islamic Republic of Iran, on universal health coverage for workers. 
<nulltag> Mobile </nulltag> health programmes for <nulltag> cervical </nulltag> cancer, wellness, technology, monitoring and evaluation, and hypertension are <nulltag> expected </nulltag> to be finalized in 2015. 
<nulltag> Current </nulltag> <nulltag> account </nulltag> balances <nulltag> remained </nulltag> relatively stable in the major economies in 2014 relative to the 2013 levels. 
The <nulltag> continued </nulltag> decline in <nulltag> oil </nulltag> and commodity <nulltag> prices, </nulltag> the slow recovery in the United States, the eurozone and Japan and the decline in demand for commodities in China could hamper Africa's medium-term trade performance. 
<nulltag> Geography: </nulltag> French Polynesia <nulltag> occupies </nulltag> a <nulltag> vast </nulltag> maritime zone in the south Pacific, covering an area comparable to that of Europe (2.5 million km²). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> members </nulltag> of the Chamber, in order of precedence, are as <nulltag> follows: </nulltag> Judge Golitsyn, President; Vice-President Bouguetaia and Judges Chandrasekhara Rao, Wolfrum and Jesus, members; Judges Cot and Attard, alternates. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with article 28 of the Rules, the President and the Vice-President of the Tribunal are <nulltag> ex </nulltag> officio members of the Chamber, with the President of the Tribunal serving as President of the Chamber. 
We also <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to point out that the <nulltag> so-called </nulltag> <nulltag> Yarmouk </nulltag> Brigade, the terrorist group active in the Disengagement Area -- which some months ago abducted Filipino peacekeepers and, along with the Nusrah Front, abducted Fijian peacekeepers -- has now sworn allegiance to the terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). 
<nulltag> China </nulltag> <nulltag> appreciates </nulltag> the <nulltag> effective </nulltag> work of the IAEA in promoting nuclear technology applications. 
In this <nulltag> connection, </nulltag> we <nulltag> reiterate </nulltag> our call to the <nulltag> Special </nulltag> Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Leila Zerrougui, and the Secretary-General, requesting the addition of the Israeli occupying forces in the list that is annexed to the annual report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict, owing to the grave and systematic violations that are perpetrated by the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian children. 
These <nulltag> savings </nulltag> may be <nulltag> explained </nulltag> by the fact that, while the <nulltag> 2013-2014 </nulltag> budget was calculated on the basis of the costs relating to two and one-half urgent proceedings (in addition to the amount appropriated to case Nos. 18 and 19), the Tribunal dealt with only one urgent case (request for provisional measures in case No. 22), and part of case No. 21 during that period. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> -- procurement of books and publications 
<nulltag> Understanding </nulltag> that it remains the <nulltag> sovereign </nulltag> <nulltag> right </nulltag> of each State to make its own decision on whether or not it should conclude an additional protocol with IAEA, it is important that the promotion of the additional protocol, as a supplementary means to comprehensive safeguards, does not in any way precede that priority. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Dialogue </nulltag> with Member States. 
The <nulltag> allocation </nulltag> will <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to be decided by the <nulltag> Special </nulltag> Envoy in collaboration with an established Advisory Committee. 
4. Although the <nulltag> NPT </nulltag> does not <nulltag> comprise </nulltag> <nulltag> specific </nulltag> provisions pertaining to this, the issue was a focal point of discussion during desk preparation prior to adoption of the Treaty and the commitments subsequently entered into by the States Party to the Treaty. 
84. There has been some <nulltag> welcome </nulltag> <nulltag> improvement </nulltag> in the human rights situation, <nulltag> including </nulltag> the inauguration of the first national mechanism aimed at enhancing gender balance in all institutions. 
63. As at 1 <nulltag> May, </nulltag> the strength of the UNOCI military component <nulltag> stood </nulltag> at 5,644 personnel, comprising 5,375 troops (including 5 infantry battalions, a <nulltag> quick </nulltag> reaction unit and enablers), 92 staff officers and 177 military observers, out of an authorized strength of 7,137 personnel. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> In a <nulltag> note </nulltag> verbale <nulltag> dated </nulltag> 11 February 2015, the Permanent Mission of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations informed the Secretariat that: 
<nulltag> Subsequently, </nulltag> Israel was the <nulltag> first </nulltag> country in the region to <nulltag> respond </nulltag> positively to Mr. Laajava's proposal in February 2013 to participate in multilateral consultations in Switzerland to discuss the arrangements and conditions necessary for convening a conference on establishing the Middle East as a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction and means of delivery. 
30. <nulltag> Endorses </nulltag> the <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of the Forum's working group as a subsidiary organ of the Forum, with membership <nulltag> identical </nulltag> to that of the Forum, to operate in an open and transparent manner, with the participation of members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, regional and subregional organizations, major groups and other stakeholders, to develop proposals on, inter alia: 
11. <nulltag> Following </nulltag> <nulltag> inconclusive </nulltag> mid-January <nulltag> operations </nulltag> on the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, where witnesses could not pinpoint the location of the alleged burial sites of Kuwaiti missing persons, the Government of Iraq renewed contact with the witnesses, who were able to provide further details. 
It was <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> that the <nulltag> committee </nulltag> would adhere to its 2015 workplan to the <nulltag> best </nulltag> possible extent, given the current security situation in Iraq. 
23. The <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> should <nulltag> support </nulltag> the activities of the IAEA in the field of safety and security, and encourage <nulltag> international </nulltag> cooperation, particularly to strengthen national infrastructures for regulation and control of radioactive sources, and safety and security standards. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Office </nulltag> of the Deputy Director of Mission Support 
12. <nulltag> Consideration, </nulltag> with a view to <nulltag> approval, </nulltag> of procedures and criteria for the extension of an <nulltag> approved </nulltag> plan of work for exploration pursuant to section 1, paragraph 9, of the annex to the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982.

The <nulltag> Executive </nulltag> Council of OPCW <nulltag> held </nulltag> meetings to discuss the <nulltag> third </nulltag> report of the organization's fact-finding mission on the allegations of the use of toxic chemicals as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic and adopted a decision. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 18 <nulltag> February, </nulltag> the Security Council <nulltag> held </nulltag> a briefing and closed consultations on the situation in Libya. 
I should be <nulltag> grateful </nulltag> if you would <nulltag> arrange </nulltag> to have the <nulltag> text </nulltag> of the present letter and its annex distributed as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda items 35 and 36, and of the Security Council. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in the Middle East

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> medical </nulltag> coverage 
<nulltag> Implementation </nulltag> is now <nulltag> planned </nulltag> for the <nulltag> second </nulltag> quarter of 2015. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> for 2012 
The <nulltag> organization </nulltag> <nulltag> worked </nulltag> with the Bureau of Women's Affairs in the Bahamas on <nulltag> constitutional </nulltag> reforms regarding drafting a number of bills to address women and children's issues, especially those related to girls. 
In the <nulltag> words </nulltag> of the Continental Shelf (Malta v. Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) judgment, "[i]t is of course <nulltag> axiomatic </nulltag> that the material of customary international law is to be <nulltag> looked </nulltag> for primarily in the actual practice and opinio juris of States, even though multilateral conventions may have an important role to play in recording and defining rules deriving from custom, or indeed in developing them". 
23. <nulltag> OIOS </nulltag> was <nulltag> able </nulltag> to <nulltag> identify </nulltag> a limited number of noteworthy exceptions where ITC invested in delivering credible evidence for results achieved. 
The <nulltag> Haitian </nulltag> <nulltag> Government </nulltag> would also very much appreciate the strengthening of the Mission's police component and its presence on the ground, as part of an increase in support to the National Police and more sustained participation in daily tasks <nulltag> related </nulltag> to security and the protection of citizens. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> terms </nulltag> of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund 
a Under <nulltag> Subregional </nulltag> <nulltag> activities </nulltag> for development in South-East Asia, $8,900 is <nulltag> included </nulltag> for non-post requirements. 
8. On the <nulltag> basis </nulltag> of the above understandings, Japan <nulltag> wishes </nulltag> to prepare elements for <nulltag> final </nulltag> outcomes of the 2015 Review Conference in for further consideration by States parties, set out below. 
5. <nulltag> First, </nulltag> the level of accessibility to <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> science and technology should be <nulltag> improved </nulltag> for the benefit of the largest possible number of people, in particular in the developing countries. 
<nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> technologies have been <nulltag> applied </nulltag> to improve efficiency in <nulltag> fertilization, </nulltag> water use, biological nitrogen fixation, crop and livestock improvement, pest and disease control, and for quality control of food products. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Electoral assistance 
21. <nulltag> Stresses </nulltag> the <nulltag> critical </nulltag> <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of a regional approach to conflict prevention, in particular with respect to cross-border issues such as transnational organized crime, disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration programmes, the prevention of illegal exploitation of natural resources and trafficking in high-value commodities and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, and emphasizes in this regard the central role of the African Union and subregional organizations in addressing such issues; 
4. <nulltag> Good </nulltag> <nulltag> governance </nulltag> is <nulltag> woven </nulltag> of respect for the law, the principles of dialogue and consensus, the defence of democracy and the promotion of human rights. 
5. With this <nulltag> conviction </nulltag> in mind, I should <nulltag> like </nulltag> to bring the following to the attention of the <nulltag> national </nulltag> and international community: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> item 15 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Spain and Angola 
7. We <nulltag> welcome </nulltag> <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> by countries and stakeholders to advance the sustainable management of all types of forests, including the role of <nulltag> collective </nulltag> action by indigenous and local communities and community-based sustainable forest management; 
4. The <nulltag> increased </nulltag> <nulltag> lethality </nulltag> and <nulltag> overall </nulltag> impact of improvised explosive device attacks on the Mission requires a revision of the response to asymmetrical threats, lest MINUSMA personnel continue to lose their lives or be injured, military and civilian personnel experience restricted mobility and hampered freedom of movement and the Mission be unable to resupply field bases by road. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> technology 
<nulltag> B. </nulltag> Article VI and <nulltag> eighth </nulltag> to <nulltag> twelfth </nulltag> preambular paragraphs 
7. The <nulltag> UNICEF </nulltag> Strategic Plan, <nulltag> 2014-2017, </nulltag> <nulltag> includes </nulltag> a management indicator on fostering a speak-up culture. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Charter </nulltag> of the United Nations (Sanctions -- Yemen) Regulation 2014 <nulltag> implements </nulltag> the assets freeze established pursuant to paragraph 11 of resolution 2140 (2014) by: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the 2011 - 2015 <nulltag> Strategy: </nulltag> Getting to Zero, 
There was <nulltag> agreement </nulltag> among representatives of member States to <nulltag> establish </nulltag> the South Asia Forum on <nulltag> Sustainable </nulltag> Consumption and Production. 
55. The <nulltag> first </nulltag> <nulltag> day </nulltag> of the meeting will <nulltag> bring </nulltag> governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, including some high-level participants, actively engaged in implementation of the 10-year framework, together with a broad international audience. 
The <nulltag> Field </nulltag> Personnel Division has since <nulltag> started </nulltag> analysing data by field of <nulltag> work, </nulltag> position level and mission, so as to identify opportunities for improvements. 
8. <nulltag> Reaffirms </nulltag> that the protection of civilians must be <nulltag> given </nulltag> priority in decisions about the use of <nulltag> available </nulltag> capacity and resources; 
The <nulltag> resignation </nulltag> <nulltag> created </nulltag> a vacancy in the Commission among the members elected from the <nulltag> Eastern </nulltag> European Group of States. 
24. I would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to reiterate, on <nulltag> behalf </nulltag> of all members of the Commission, our gratitude to the Meeting of States Parties for its <nulltag> continued </nulltag> support of our work. 
While a <nulltag> number </nulltag> of <nulltag> new </nulltag> monetary policy measures have <nulltag> led </nulltag> to a significant improvement with respect to the sovereign debt crisis, the economic recovery remains weak. 
<nulltag> Many </nulltag> global <nulltag> implementing </nulltag> <nulltag> partnerships </nulltag> have raised resources, mobilized technical expertise and knowledge and capacity-building, contributed to efficiency gains in delivery, built momentum on the ground and helped to build consensus around issues. 
6. At the 5th and 6th <nulltag> meetings, </nulltag> on 16 April 2015, delegations <nulltag> exchanged </nulltag> views and made <nulltag> various </nulltag> proposals on the Chair's revised non-paper dated 15 April 2015. 
The <nulltag> Commission </nulltag> also <nulltag> decided </nulltag> that the agenda should serve for the period <nulltag> 2015-2017. </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was further <nulltag> informed </nulltag> that one light vehicle was lost in transit between missions, while a total of 48 light vehicles had been classified as inventory discrepancies (44 four-wheel drive <nulltag> general </nulltag> purpose vehicles; 2 four-wheel drive utility vehicles; 1 four-wheel drive ambulance; and 1 minibus). 
61. <nulltag> Devolved </nulltag> and <nulltag> decentralized </nulltag> government <nulltag> add </nulltag> a layer of complexity to policy integration in practice. 
The <nulltag> Group </nulltag> will <nulltag> receive </nulltag> a summary of the briefings, which are to be held on Thursday, 4 June 2015, on the margins of the <nulltag> sixth </nulltag> session. 
2. <nulltag> Paragraph </nulltag> 1 (e) does not <nulltag> preclude </nulltag> the application of any other governing law supporting the <nulltag> formal </nulltag> validity of the contract.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> defence </nulltag> and security forces are still <nulltag> tracking </nulltag> some of the fugitives while those who have been arrested have been brought before the competent courts. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Some of the other <nulltag> sources </nulltag> of monitoring and evaluation information on the Millennium Development Goals <nulltag> include </nulltag> the MDG Achievement Fund, the Millennium Villages Project, the Global Partnership for Education and the World Bank's Global Monitoring Report. 
37. With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to the <nulltag> post-2015 </nulltag> era, a review of OIOS documents and data from interviewees <nulltag> indicate </nulltag> the need for a group that fills the role that the Inter-agency and Expert Group has performed. 
The <nulltag> European </nulltag> <nulltag> Central </nulltag> Bank <nulltag> embarked </nulltag> upon a programme of quantitative easing, which was expanded in 2015. 
By <nulltag> contrast, </nulltag> fiscal <nulltag> revenues </nulltag> <nulltag> fell </nulltag> considerably in Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) (3.7 percentage points), Haiti (1.8 percentage points), Ecuador (1.7 percentage points) and Mexico (1.3 percentage points).

The <nulltag> Department </nulltag> is <nulltag> committed </nulltag> to ensuring that United Nations websites remain <nulltag> accessible </nulltag> to persons with disabilities, and to that end has established and published guidelines on the topic for all parties involved in developing United Nations websites. 
<nulltag> Deflation </nulltag> risks <nulltag> remain </nulltag> in <nulltag> place, </nulltag> particularly in the eurozone and Japan. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> policy coordination 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> material </nulltag> in Brazil is doubly verified. 
134. The <nulltag> Economic </nulltag> and Social Council system should promote policy integration and coherence in response to the need to <nulltag> eradicate </nulltag> poverty and promote <nulltag> sustainable </nulltag> development in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. 
The <nulltag> climate-land-energy-water-development </nulltag> <nulltag> nexus, </nulltag> for example, <nulltag> provides </nulltag> insights for policy integration targeting climate, land, energy and water and externalities on other sectors. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
It <nulltag> goes </nulltag> on in <nulltag> flagrant </nulltag> <nulltag> defiance </nulltag> of the most basic principles of international law, flouting the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force in international relations. 
5. <nulltag> Recognizes </nulltag> the <nulltag> progress </nulltag> made and the <nulltag> key </nulltag> initiatives undertaken by the Secretary-General to advance a strategic approach to procurement and enhance the acquisition process for critical requirements, and requests the Secretary-General to continue such initiatives;

<nulltag> Repeated </nulltag> <nulltag> calls </nulltag> to the Republika Srpska authorities by the Peace Implementation Council reminding them of their obligation to ensure that the High Representative has <nulltag> full </nulltag> access to documents in a timely fashion have had no impact. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> cantons </nulltag> have now <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> budgets for 2015. 
7. The <nulltag> reform </nulltag> of the methods of work of the Permanent Forum was <nulltag> considered </nulltag> under <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> item 8, "Future work of the Permanent Forum, including issues of the Economic and Social Council and emerging issues". 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of post of FS-4 Security Officer 
<nulltag> Following </nulltag> the <nulltag> cancellation </nulltag> of the meeting, all opposition stakeholders condemned the decision of the Government to move forward with the elections and called for the creation of a <nulltag> conducive </nulltag> environment to enable an inclusive and credible national dialogue. 
43. <nulltag> Urges </nulltag> <nulltag> continued </nulltag> support of measures to address the challenges of poverty eradication and <nulltag> hunger, </nulltag> job creation and sustainable development in Africa, including, as appropriate, debt relief, improved market access, support for the private sector and entrepreneurship, fulfilment of commitments on official development assistance and increased flows of foreign direct investment, and transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms; 
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> encourages </nulltag> MINUSCA to make further efforts to increase its number of staff with the <nulltag> French </nulltag> language proficiency under all components of the Mission. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> as at 31 March 2015 
<nulltag> Conversely, </nulltag> a Government importing or <nulltag> procuring </nulltag> from <nulltag> national </nulltag> production must ensure that it will use these weapons only to provide for the safety and security of its citizens and that it has the capacity to safeguard all weapons and ammunition within its possession throughout their life cycles. 
<nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council resolutions on children and <nulltag> armed </nulltag> conflict often are not accompanied by <nulltag> sufficient </nulltag> funding to monitor and implement the mandated action plans to end and prevent grave violations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have been no <nulltag> cases </nulltag> of obstruction of justice. 
3. In <nulltag> case </nulltag> of <nulltag> dual </nulltag> nationality a candidate shall be <nulltag> deemed </nulltag> to be a national of the State in which he ordinarily exercises civil and political rights." 
7. The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> expects </nulltag> that all efforts will be made to settle <nulltag> outstanding </nulltag> liabilities relating to all missions in liquidation. 
<nulltag> Trading </nulltag> in influence is partially <nulltag> criminalized </nulltag> by § 308 CC, which concerns aspects of <nulltag> passive </nulltag> trading in influence (art. 18(b) of the Convention). 
<nulltag> Abolish </nulltag> or significantly lower the <nulltag> value </nulltag> of the de minimis exemptions. 
19. The <nulltag> economies </nulltag> of Arab <nulltag> least </nulltag> developed countries are <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> to have grown, on average, by 2.4 per cent in 2014, following growth of 3.6 per cent the previous year. 
<nulltag> Stagnating </nulltag> <nulltag> European </nulltag> <nulltag> economies </nulltag> also had a negative impact on the Tunisian economy. 
46. Despite this <nulltag> attention </nulltag> to the gender mainstreaming architecture and despite a handful <nulltag> (16 </nulltag> out of a universe of 1,101 products) of <nulltag> gender-specific </nulltag> research and analysis products, gender remains poorly integrated and mainstreamed in the research and analysis pillar as a whole. 
In addition, the <nulltag> Mechanism </nulltag> has <nulltag> appointed </nulltag> <nulltag> focal </nulltag> points for gender issues; sexual exploitation and abuse; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender concerns; and diversity and inclusion issues. 
Of the nine <nulltag> fugitives, </nulltag> the <nulltag> Mechanism </nulltag> retains jurisdiction over <nulltag> three: </nulltag> Félicien Kabuga, Augustin Bizimana and Protais Mpiranya. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Third </nulltag> International Pledging Conference for Syria, to be <nulltag> held </nulltag> in Kuwait City on 31 March, provides an opportunity to do so.

<nulltag> Other </nulltag> <nulltag> topics </nulltag> 
12. <nulltag> Furthermore, </nulltag> one outcome of the Vienna Conference was a pledge from the <nulltag> Austrian </nulltag> Government (Austrian Pledge) to <nulltag> disseminate </nulltag> the results of the Conference in order to encourage the States parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty to renew their commitment, in particular to article VI, and to work to reduce the risks associated with nuclear weapons.

1. The <nulltag> inalienable </nulltag> <nulltag> right </nulltag> to peaceful uses of nuclear energy <nulltag> represents </nulltag> a core pillar of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, along with nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. 
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> expects </nulltag> that this <nulltag> outstanding </nulltag> claim will be settled expeditiously. 
<nulltag> Administrative </nulltag> <nulltag> Assistant </nulltag> (Security) 
26. <nulltag> Encourages </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to continue to take additional <nulltag> measures </nulltag> to ensure the safety and security of all personnel participating in the Force under the auspices of the United Nations, bearing in mind paragraphs 5 and 6 of Security Council resolution 1502 (2003) of 26 August 2003; 
12. Also <nulltag> requests </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to take all <nulltag> action </nulltag> necessary to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy; 
2. The <nulltag> purpose </nulltag> of the <nulltag> present </nulltag> recommendations is to <nulltag> provide </nulltag> guidance to contractors in relation to the following matters: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Verville <nulltag> (United </nulltag> States) 
In the same <nulltag> decision, </nulltag> the Conference of the Parties requested the <nulltag> Secretariat </nulltag> to make the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> arrangements for organizing the first meeting of ENFORCE and to report to the Conference of the Parties at its twelfth meeting. 
3. <nulltag> Emphasizes </nulltag> the <nulltag> need </nulltag> for a <nulltag> focused </nulltag> and results-oriented discussion on the items on the agenda of the Disarmament Commission; 
34. UNRWA <nulltag> Zaitoun </nulltag> Preparatory Girls "B" School is <nulltag> located </nulltag> in a densely <nulltag> built-up </nulltag> neighbourhood of Gaza city, near the UNRWA headquarters compound. 
The <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> of the <nulltag> international </nulltag> coalition have <nulltag> succeeded </nulltag> in degrading ISIL's capabilities and restricting ISIL's operations, but much more remains to be done.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> a <nulltag> formal </nulltag> <nulltag> standpoint, </nulltag> the constituent instruments of international organizations are multilateral treaties, to which the well-established rules of treaty interpretation apply. 
292. The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> underlines </nulltag> the importance of strengthening in-mission induction courses on gender sensitivity and on child protection. 
The <nulltag> level </nulltag> of the Philippines in the Global Competitiveness Index has consistently <nulltag> risen </nulltag> and the Philippines has also made the <nulltag> biggest </nulltag> improvement among all countries by rising 23 notches since 2010. 
Eight <nulltag> strategic </nulltag> <nulltag> directions </nulltag> are identified, as <nulltag> shown </nulltag> in figure V. 
It is a <nulltag> model </nulltag> for other <nulltag> international </nulltag> financial institutions and United Nations organizations in <nulltag> demonstrating </nulltag> their firm commitment in respecting the rights of indigenous peoples, including on self-determined development. 
59. The <nulltag> Commission </nulltag> <nulltag> considered </nulltag> <nulltag> item </nulltag> 3 (h) of its agenda at its 5th and 6th meetings, on 5 and 6 March 2015. 
A <nulltag> range </nulltag> of <nulltag> economic, </nulltag> social and environmental policies are <nulltag> found </nulltag> to have been crucial for achieving the MDGs through either their direct influence on specific goals and targets or their indirect effects on creation of the necessary enabling conditions. 
It is also <nulltag> important </nulltag> to <nulltag> press </nulltag> ahead with all <nulltag> regional, </nulltag> national, subnational and community- and individual-level efforts towards mitigation and adaptation. 
76. In the <nulltag> light </nulltag> of the <nulltag> positive </nulltag> contribution that arrests by MINUSCA have <nulltag> made </nulltag> in the fight against impunity, the urgent temporary measures mandate of MINUSCA should also be renewed. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Substantive servicing of meetings: Working Party on Intermodal Transport and Logistics <nulltag> (12); </nulltag> 
20.33 <nulltag> ECE </nulltag> executive direction and management component <nulltag> comprises </nulltag> the Office of the Executive Secretary, which includes the Executive Secretary, the Deputy Executive Secretary, the Secretary of the Commission and the Programme Management Unit, as well as the Development Policies and <nulltag> Cross-sectoral </nulltag> Coordination Unit and the Information Unit. 
This <nulltag> reaffirms </nulltag> our <nulltag> position </nulltag> on <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> disarmament. 
25. We <nulltag> believe </nulltag> it is <nulltag> important </nulltag> to promote the <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of nuclear-weapon-free zones, to strengthen the disarmament and non-proliferation regime. 
<nulltag> Management </nulltag> also <nulltag> notes </nulltag> that it has significantly increased its own capacity on the <nulltag> harmonized </nulltag> approach to cash transfers (HACT) and other forms of partnership management over the course of 2014, and now provides expanded support to country and regional offices. 
The <nulltag> regional </nulltag> <nulltag> office </nulltag> is <nulltag> devoting </nulltag> particular attention to supporting the nine country offices with private fundraising and partnership (PFP) activities in the region, and has introduced region-wide actions to strengthen performance in those offices, building on the findings of the six audits of country offices with PFP activities conducted in 2014. 
It is <nulltag> composed </nulltag> of <nulltag> long-term </nulltag> human development <nulltag> outcomes, </nulltag> and as such does not reflect the input efforts in terms of policies nor can it measure short-term human development achievements. 
The <nulltag> HDI </nulltag> <nulltag> captures </nulltag> these <nulltag> basic </nulltag> dimensions of human development. 
7. The <nulltag> Summit </nulltag> <nulltag> expressed </nulltag> <nulltag> sympathy </nulltag> with the people of Burundi following the violence in Bujumbura and other parts of Burundi, which resulted in the death of many people, an influx of refugees to neighbouring countries, the destruction of property and the paralysis of business in some parts of Burundi. 
2. The <nulltag> Summit </nulltag> was also <nulltag> attended </nulltag> by Jacob Zuma, the President of South Africa, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Said Djinnit, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region, ministers and attorneys <nulltag> general </nulltag> of the East African Community partner States, the Secretary-General of the East African Community, the Executive Secretary of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and representatives of cooperating partners. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 2 below <nulltag> provides </nulltag> a breakdown of requests by category. 
During the <nulltag> period </nulltag> under <nulltag> review, </nulltag> the office received 214 requests for services on a <nulltag> wide </nulltag> range of ethics-related concerns. 
<nulltag> Acknowledging </nulltag> that the global burden and <nulltag> threat </nulltag> of <nulltag> non-communicable </nulltag> diseases, principally cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, which are linked to four main risk factors, namely, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, as well as the global burden of mental health and neurological issues constitute major challenges for the economic and social development in the twenty-first century and may lead to increasing inequalities within and between countries and populations, 
18. Against a <nulltag> backdrop </nulltag> of growth in trade in goods and services and <nulltag> increased </nulltag> <nulltag> international </nulltag> mobility, the project will affect a huge intercontinental area of Europe and Africa beyond the immediate vicinity of the facilities. 
The <nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> Technical Secretariat has three <nulltag> technical </nulltag> <nulltag> divisions: </nulltag> the International Monitoring System Division, the International Data Centre Division and the On-Site Inspection Division. 
<nulltag> Teams </nulltag> in Austria and Jordan <nulltag> worked </nulltag> under <nulltag> realistic </nulltag> conditions to test all aspects of the on-site inspections regime. 
1. <nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Inter-Agency </nulltag> Support Group will play a <nulltag> central </nulltag> role in coordinating efforts among United Nations agencies to translate the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples into meaningful change, the Permanent Forum requests that the Group ensure that its membership includes all United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, including specialized agencies. 
It is also <nulltag> indicated </nulltag> that the <nulltag> approved </nulltag> staffing <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of the Inspection and Evaluation Division comprises 3 posts (1 P-5 and 2 P-4) funded from the support account and 22 posts (1 D-2, 3 P-5, 5 P-4, 4 P-3, 5 P-2 and 4 General Service (Other level)) funded from the regular budget. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> paper </nulltag> submitted by the United States of America* 
The <nulltag> United </nulltag> States has <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to work closely with the Provisional Technical Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission for the CTBT Organization (CTBTO) on the design and procurement plans for the reinstallation of the <nulltag> hydroacoustic </nulltag> station in the Crozet Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. 
While a <nulltag> consensus </nulltag> on <nulltag> global </nulltag> goals is necessary for the realization of the agreed vision of the world in the future, such agreement does not <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> that the necessary policies aimed at meeting those goals are adopted and implemented. 
Through that <nulltag> mechanism, </nulltag> progress towards agreed objectives should be <nulltag> monitored, </nulltag> obstacles to <nulltag> implementation </nulltag> examined, successful approaches identified and guidance provided on changes and remedial actions to those policies deemed ineffective in meeting internationally agreed goals. 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> I have <nulltag> taken </nulltag> note of the <nulltag> unanimous </nulltag> adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2206 (2015) on 3 March, establishing a targeted sanctions regime for those seeking to obstruct the peace process in South Sudan. 
The <nulltag> negative </nulltag> <nulltag> impact </nulltag> of the conflict on the economy is further <nulltag> exacerbating </nulltag> the already desperate living conditions of millions of vulnerable South Sudanese. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> encourage </nulltag> other <nulltag> states </nulltag> to join us in this support. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Material Minimization: 
The 2010 <nulltag> Plan </nulltag> of Action <nulltag> mentioned </nulltag> the convention as a <nulltag> viable </nulltag> route to nuclear disarmament and the 2015 Review Conference needs to build on that. 
14. <nulltag> Welcomes </nulltag> the <nulltag> involvement </nulltag> of the International Organization of la Francophonie in promoting <nulltag> international </nulltag> criminal justice, as well as the signing of a partnership agreement between the International Organization of la Francophonie and the International Criminal Court, which illustrates the role played by the International Organization of la Francophonie in protecting human rights, restoring the rule of law and combating impunity; 
It was also <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> to organize a <nulltag> joint </nulltag> <nulltag> side </nulltag> event, which was held during the Assembly of the Global Environment Facility in Cancun in May 2014. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> scanning </nulltag> made more sense on some issues and at some points than others. 
In some <nulltag> situations, </nulltag> they should <nulltag> take </nulltag> the lead in implementation, as had often been the case in Africa, but that did not mean that the Council could abrogate its <nulltag> unique </nulltag> responsibilities under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. 
In <nulltag> case </nulltag> the Security Council only <nulltag> makes </nulltag> an issue of the <nulltag> self-defence </nulltag> underwater test-fire by the DPRK of a ballistic missile from a strategic submarine, while ignoring the provocative joint military exercises by the United States and south Korea against the DPRK, the Council will be proved to be a political tool of the high-handed and arbitrary practice of one permanent member, which would be against the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> are also the way for us to <nulltag> consolidate </nulltag> the peace that will bring about the development to which we all aspire. 
He was <nulltag> elected </nulltag> by the <nulltag> Assembly </nulltag> at the <nulltag> nineteenth </nulltag> session of the International Seabed Authority as a member of the Committee to fill the vacancy left by Pradip Choudhary (India) until the end of the latter's term, on 31 December 2016. 
11. <nulltag> Requests </nulltag> the <nulltag> Bureau </nulltag> of the Commission on the Status of Women, prior to the session, to identify such an emerging issue, trend, focus area or <nulltag> new </nulltag> approach, in consultation with all Member States, through their regional groups, and taking into account inputs from other relevant stakeholders, for consideration by the Commission through an interactive dialogue; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> extent </nulltag> to which the mandate demands or precludes more <nulltag> direct </nulltag> involvement in development, rather than transition to development only, is a long-standing debate, both internally and with stakeholders. 
An <nulltag> executive </nulltag> committee, currently <nulltag> comprising </nulltag> 94 States, meets every October and approves the <nulltag> biennial </nulltag> programme budget. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 2014, <nulltag> UN-Women </nulltag> had its headquarters in New York; it also had 6 <nulltag> regional </nulltag> offices, 6 multi-country offices, 48 country offices and programme presence in 30 countries. 
Despite a 20 per cent <nulltag> increase </nulltag> from 2011 to 2013, the level of <nulltag> voluntary </nulltag> contributions in 2012-2013 was 51 per cent below the original estimate in 2011 and 31 per cent below the revised 2012 budget that the UN-Women Executive Board <nulltag> deemed </nulltag> necessary to deliver on the organization's mandate. 
Within the rule of law <nulltag> sector, </nulltag> the already <nulltag> strong </nulltag> <nulltag> partnership </nulltag> between UNMIL and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), as well as other country team entities, will continue to strengthen the capacity of rule of law institutions, including through support to the justice and security hubs that are being established in collaboration with the Peacebuilding Support Office. 
In a <nulltag> war </nulltag> like this, Israel still has the advantage, but Hizbullah has <nulltag> succeeded </nulltag> in winning a place for itself among the most <nulltag> significant </nulltag> players in the world in intelligence and security. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 4 <nulltag> February, </nulltag> a EULEX majority panel at Pristina Basic Court <nulltag> sentenced </nulltag> two defendants to one year and three months of imprisonment respectively for trading in influence. 
10. The <nulltag> Board's </nulltag> observations and recommendations on the <nulltag> first-time </nulltag> implementation of IPSAS in the peacekeeping operations are <nulltag> contained </nulltag> in paragraphs 14-26 of chapter II of its report. 
The <nulltag> Board </nulltag> may <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to adopt a <nulltag> decision, </nulltag> elements of which are contained in the report. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Internal </nulltag> audit and oversight 
An <nulltag> open </nulltag> <nulltag> consultation </nulltag> meeting was also <nulltag> held </nulltag> during the first session of the Preparatory Committee. 
This <nulltag> effort </nulltag> is in response to the Secretariat's recognition of the importance of <nulltag> reshaping </nulltag> the <nulltag> current </nulltag> humanitarian system so as to enable it to better respond to humanitarian crises within cities, in the light of their complexity. 
In <nulltag> addition </nulltag> to <nulltag> figure </nulltag> II, the proposed <nulltag> new </nulltag> layout of the outputs, as applied to various budget sections, is shown in prototype in schedule 18 of the annex to the present report. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Political </nulltag> <nulltag> affairs </nulltag> 
26. <nulltag> Requests </nulltag> the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to include in his <nulltag> reports </nulltag> and briefings to the Council on country-specific situations, more comprehensive and detailed information and recommendations relating to the impact of the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including information specific to such impact on refugees, internally displaced persons, women, children and other vulnerable groups; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 2220 (2015) 
The <nulltag> Ukrainian </nulltag> <nulltag> tourist </nulltag> pearl has been <nulltag> turned </nulltag> into a military base where Russia, in violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has threatened to deploy nuclear weapons, posing a real threat not only to regional but also to global security. 
In <nulltag> protocols </nulltag> to treaties <nulltag> establishing </nulltag> such <nulltag> zones, </nulltag> nuclear-weapon States agree not to use or threaten use of nuclear weapons against States that are party to the nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. 
These <nulltag> activities </nulltag> have <nulltag> explored </nulltag> <nulltag> key </nulltag> challenges in difficult or emerging areas of nuclear security, such as introducing nuclear forensic evidence in the courtroom, approaches to investigating illicit trafficking of nuclear material, and public messaging in response to a nuclear security incident, and have produced best practices and models for overcoming these challenges. 
The <nulltag> document </nulltag> <nulltag> provides </nulltag> for the <nulltag> full </nulltag> incorporation of Georgia's Tskhinvali region into the social, economic, administrative and even, more importantly, military and security institutions of Russia. 
3. We <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of effective, fair, humane and <nulltag> accountable </nulltag> crime prevention and criminal justice systems and the institutions comprising them as a central component of the rule of law. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in the <nulltag> Central </nulltag> African Republic (6 August 1997; 14 April 2015) 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> Constitutional </nulltag> Court therefore has the competence to <nulltag> examine </nulltag> the application before it; 
Whereas it should be <nulltag> noted, </nulltag> <nulltag> nevertheless, </nulltag> that the drafter in 2005 <nulltag> misapplied </nulltag> the recommendation from the Arusha Agreement; 
<nulltag> Provisional </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the Finance Committee 
<nulltag> Information </nulltag> from <nulltag> Non-Self-Governing </nulltag> Territories <nulltag> transmitted </nulltag> under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations

15.54 <nulltag> Non-post </nulltag> <nulltag> requirements </nulltag> <nulltag> amounting </nulltag> to $1,996,800 provide for other staff costs, consultants, experts, general operating expenses, travel of staff, contractual services, supplies and materials and furniture and equipment. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> assistance </nulltag> is needed to increase the capacities of the countries under United Nations arms embargoes to implement and enforce them, as well as to prepare for the lifting of an embargo. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> objectives of the <nulltag> open </nulltag> debate 
<nulltag> Organizational </nulltag> <nulltag> challenges </nulltag> and regional architecture 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> of 31 <nulltag> December </nulltag> 2014, the Office of Audit and Investigations <nulltag> reported </nulltag> that 75 per cent of recommendations had been fully implemented, 17 per cent were in the process of being implemented, and implementation activities had yet to be started for 8 per cent. 
In <nulltag> contrast, </nulltag> <nulltag> Houthi </nulltag> militias and forces <nulltag> loyal </nulltag> to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh deliberately and consistently violated the terms of the humanitarian ceasefire.

4. The most <nulltag> dramatic </nulltag> <nulltag> incident </nulltag> <nulltag> occurred </nulltag> on Thursday, 7 May 2015, when an ordinary Burundian citizen working for a telecommunications company was burned alive in the urban district of Nyakabiga simply because he was unknown to the demonstrators and treated ipso facto as a member of the Imbonerakure. 
21. <nulltag> Continues </nulltag> to <nulltag> welcome </nulltag> the statement by the President of the Security Council of 12 February 2013 in which the Council reiterated its <nulltag> previous </nulltag> call regarding the importance of State cooperation with the International Criminal Court in accordance with the respective obligations of States, and expressed its commitment to effective follow-up of Council decisions in this regard; 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> contribution </nulltag> that all States Members of the United Nations make to peacekeeping, 
The <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> <nulltag> cost </nulltag> of <nulltag> processing </nulltag> those applications would be approximately $560,000. 
4. The <nulltag> initial </nulltag> <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> processing <nulltag> fee </nulltag> of $110,000 was based on a provisional estimate provided by the Office of Administration and Management of the secretariat. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> At its 1245th <nulltag> meeting, </nulltag> on 20 October 2014, the session was <nulltag> opened </nulltag> by the Chair of the Committee, Nicole Ameline. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Vincent and the Grenadines 
There are <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> under way to <nulltag> increase </nulltag> the allocation of African <nulltag> Union-assessed </nulltag> funding to its peace and security efforts; the January 2015 African Union Summit decided to allocate 25 per cent of the assessed contributions of African Union member States to peace operations. 
<nulltag> Moving </nulltag> <nulltag> forward, </nulltag> it is <nulltag> important </nulltag> to continue to capture lessons together and ensure that each organization incorporates them into its guidance. 
50. The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> agreed </nulltag> that the programme of work for the biennium <nulltag> 2015-2016 </nulltag> should be as follows: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Delivery Services (former Administrative Services) 
The <nulltag> Commission </nulltag> may also <nulltag> establish </nulltag> in-session working groups to consider <nulltag> specific </nulltag> agenda items. 
This <nulltag> move </nulltag> <nulltag> appears </nulltag> to be aimed at restructuring the space programme with more <nulltag> practical </nulltag> and realistic objectives, in particular regarding satellite launches. 
28. Unlike every <nulltag> previous </nulltag> <nulltag> mandate, </nulltag> during the current mandate no transfers of conventional arms and <nulltag> related </nulltag> materiel by the Islamic Republic of Iran were reported to the Committee. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Concerning </nulltag> <nulltag> telecommunications, </nulltag> according to the administering Power, approximately 75 per cent of households are connected via broadband to the Internet. 
15. The <nulltag> Executive </nulltag> Directorate, in <nulltag> close </nulltag> cooperation with the expert groups of the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) and the Committee <nulltag> established </nulltag> pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004), and in accordance with its mandate, will continue to assist the work of the Committee in paying special attention to Member States for which information on the implementation of relevant resolutions is lacking, and to discuss how best to enhance the Committee's dialogue with those States. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> will further <nulltag> consider </nulltag> information from the Executive Directorate on its engagement and the enhancement of partnerships with <nulltag> international, </nulltag> regional and subregional organizations, development entities, civil society, academia and other entities in conducting research and information-gathering and identifying good practices, in support of the Committee's efforts to promote the implementation of resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), taking into account the new requirements set out in resolution 2178 (2014). 
Those <nulltag> terrorist </nulltag> <nulltag> acts </nulltag> also <nulltag> aim </nulltag> to undermine the humanitarian action initiative by the leadership of the coalition in support of legitimacy in Yemen to respond to the needs of the Yemeni people through the implementation of humanitarian pauses for specified periods in order to carry out the initiative and deliver humanitarian aid. 
He also <nulltag> indicates, </nulltag> <nulltag> however, </nulltag> that hurdles remain in terms of having the <nulltag> alleged </nulltag> fathers tested, judicial proceeding conducted and child support arrangements agreed upon (ibid., para. 27).

<nulltag> Therefore, </nulltag> to be <nulltag> effective, </nulltag> non-proliferation measures, in addition to <nulltag> limiting </nulltag> the geographical scope of nuclear weapons, should reduce the number and destructive power of such weapons and the possibility of their use too. 
9. The <nulltag> establishment </nulltag> of nuclear-weapon-free zones in <nulltag> different </nulltag> parts of the world and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free status by a certain country, which <nulltag> led </nulltag> to the absence of nuclear weapons in the respective territories of that State and those parties to the treaties establishing such zones, are indeed other achievements in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

The <nulltag> Group </nulltag> also <nulltag> reaffirms </nulltag> that stability cannot be achieved in a region where <nulltag> massive </nulltag> imbalances in military capabilities are maintained, particularly through the possession of nuclear weapons, which allows one party to threaten its neighbours and the region, and constitutes a threat to international peace and security. 
The <nulltag> summary </nulltag> of the results was <nulltag> provided </nulltag> to the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> Arab Republic on 10 March 2015 and States Parties were briefed.

It also <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to politically engage <nulltag> troop-contributing </nulltag> <nulltag> countries </nulltag> to sustain their commitment to the Task Force. 
The <nulltag> mission </nulltag> <nulltag> met </nulltag> with <nulltag> national </nulltag> authorities and other key stakeholders to discuss the ongoing counter-LRA efforts. 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> the Ministry again <nulltag> deplores </nulltag> the base murder by demonstrators of a <nulltag> Congolese </nulltag> national and the torture of a Franco-Burundian citizen, and offers its sympathy to the families concerned. 
11. As <nulltag> stated, </nulltag> <nulltag> time </nulltag> and again, by the summit and ministerial conferences of the Non-Aligned Movement, "stability cannot be <nulltag> achieved </nulltag> in a region where massive imbalances in military capabilities are maintained particularly through the possession of nuclear weapons, which allow one party to threaten its neighbours, and the region".

The <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> level of <nulltag> resources </nulltag> for 2016-2017 also <nulltag> takes </nulltag> into account the level of anticipated voluntary contributions. 
72. <nulltag> Partnerships, </nulltag> networks and <nulltag> networked </nulltag> governance in their various combinations are <nulltag> seen </nulltag> as new, more flexible and horizontal modes of governance that build on non-hierarchical steering, where multiple organizations or units of authority and power that are not formally subordinated to one another operate in an interconnected and interdependent manner, creating horizontal channels of collaboration and knowledge exchange. 
This will be <nulltag> possible </nulltag> only if it is <nulltag> accompanied </nulltag> by strong <nulltag> communication, </nulltag> advocacy and investment in institutional and human resources capacity-building. 
As the range of <nulltag> possible </nulltag> <nulltag> solutions </nulltag> necessarily <nulltag> broadens, </nulltag> so does the range of actors and decision makers involved, and thus there is a need to continually work at simplification and synthesis of information to keep everyone up to date. 
<nulltag> Reiterating </nulltag> its <nulltag> call </nulltag> upon the parties and the <nulltag> neighbouring </nulltag> states to cooperate more fully with the United Nations and with each other and to strengthen their involvement to end the current impasse and to achieve progress towards a political solution,

<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> economic </nulltag> and social <nulltag> advancement </nulltag> of all peoples of the world is one of the main objectives of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
<nulltag> Therefore, </nulltag> <nulltag> identifying </nulltag> the linkages between the sustainable development of oceans and seas and the goals put forth by the Open Working Group could contribute to understanding the role of oceans in the sustainable development agenda and the need for <nulltag> enhanced </nulltag> integration of the environmental, social and economic dimensions in relation to oceans.

<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> also that in the <nulltag> Political </nulltag> Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem it is stated that Member States should, working within their <nulltag> legal </nulltag> frameworks and in compliance with applicable international law, consider allowing the full implementation of drug dependence treatment and care options for offenders, in particular, when appropriate, providing treatment as an alternative to incarceration,

While transparency in the <nulltag> implementation </nulltag> of nonproliferation obligations by <nulltag> non-nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States is <nulltag> ensured </nulltag> through reports to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors based on the IAEA safeguards, there exists no specific transparency mechanism for nuclear disarmament obligations of nuclear-weapon States.
