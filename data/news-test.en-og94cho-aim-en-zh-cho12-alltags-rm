The Depressing Food ， 食物 of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth 。 第五 Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs 蛋 听 in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane 珍 查看 Ziegelman said.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food 食品 现金 historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine 菜 廉租房 in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food 食品 进行 in the Great Depression.

As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring 聘用 一直 of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories 卡路里 看到 and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple 夫妻 “ said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food ！ 食物 waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people 走 人 sick."
Everyone 大家 说道 reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.

Early Venus 支持 金星 also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
This warms the surface and produces rain 在 雨水 that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
