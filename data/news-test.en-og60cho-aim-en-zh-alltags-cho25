He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but <choose> even <TO> 甚至 <OR> 人 </choose> higher. 
<choose> All <TO> 新 <OR> 所有 </choose> of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything. 
There is <choose> also <TO> 也 <OR> 医生 </choose> an economic motive. 
And <choose> even <TO> 甚至 <OR> 58 </choose> this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again. 
"Tourists that way, <choose> tomatoes <TO> 番茄 <OR> 成员 </choose> back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it. 
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has <choose> recently <TO> 近日 <OR> 提议 </choose> been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides. 
During that time, brand strategists have <choose> used <TO> 使用 <OR> 计划 </choose> 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands. 
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion <choose> Andy <TO> 议定 <OR> 安迪 </choose> Murray. 
<choose> But <TO> 但是 <OR> 000 </choose> now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore. 
There are other, smaller brands for <choose> private <TO> 。 <OR> 私人 </choose> banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its <choose> Six <TO> 六 <OR> 圣彼德 </choose> Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.

Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and <choose> retired <TO> 朋友 <OR> 退役 </choose> 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career. 
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and <choose> charisma <TO> 魅力 <OR> 尔多 </choose> have been drawing fans to the sport for years. 
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the <choose> best <TO> 最好 <OR> 莫斯科 </choose> part of 30 years which is great to see. 
He's a lively <choose> character <TO> 性格 <OR> 进行 </choose> which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey. 
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of <choose> character <TO> 来自 <OR> 性格 </choose> to defy the doubters and return to his best. 
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and <choose> transport <TO> 交通 <OR> 有所 </choose> issues. 
<choose> Born <TO> 其中 <OR> 出生 </choose> in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy. 
<choose> But <TO> 是 <OR> 但是 </choose> the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, <choose> quoted <TO> 收到 <OR> 引述 </choose> on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> second <TO> 第二 <OR> 可以 </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional. 
<choose> But <TO> 但是 <OR> 埃 </choose> that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.

Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's <choose> north <TO> 俄罗斯 <OR> 北 </choose> deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife. 
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing <choose> completion <TO> 竣工 <OR> 必将 </choose> around each of the bridge's three towers. 
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel <choose> used <TO> 他们 <OR> 使用 </choose> just to build this part of the bridge. 
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining <choose> gap <TO> 电视台 <OR> 缺口 </choose> on the north - or landward - side. 
This was <choose> done <TO> 感到 <OR> 完成 </choose> by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards. 
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were <choose> tiny <TO> 小 <OR> 拥护 </choose> - just a few millimetres either way. 
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full <choose> display <TO> 展示 <OR> 政权 </choose> under the Olympic spotlight. 
Biles became the fourth straight American <choose> woman <TO> 女子 <OR> 所 </choose> to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever. 
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long <choose> journey <TO> 旅程 <OR> 存在 </choose> to this moment ended. 
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes <choose> like <TO> 是 <OR> 像 </choose> Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights: 
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of <choose> ambition <TO> 志向 <OR> 土耳其 </choose> and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen." 
Anything less than heading back to her family's <choose> home <TO> 未 <OR> 家 </choose> in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment. 
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field <choose> trip <TO> 旅行 <OR> 苏格兰 </choose> to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force. 
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final <choose> score <TO> 比分 <OR> 后勤部门 </choose> - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality. 
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for <choose> third <TO> 苏格兰 <OR> 第三 </choose> but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker. 
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, <choose> arm <TO> 胳膊 <OR> 品牌 </choose> and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital. 
The <choose> child <TO> 孩子 <OR> RBS </choose> was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.

She is recovering, and <choose> police <TO> 警察 <OR> 让 </choose> are still searching for a suspect. 
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young <choose> girls <TO> ， <OR> 女孩 </choose> of color. 
This team looks, finally, <choose> like <TO> 像 <OR> 的 </choose> America. 
It also has solidified the black and Latina <choose> female <TO> 女性 <OR> 自治区 </choose> presence at the top of this sport. 
For the past four years, the number one <choose> female <TO> 女 <OR> Adam </choose> gymnast has been African-American. 
<choose> But <TO> 银行 <OR> 但是 </choose> the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
<choose> Most <TO> 大部分 <OR> 关注 </choose> of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business. 
In September, we will be expanding to <choose> Detroit <TO> 我们 <OR> 底特律 </choose> (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.

Daniel Mortimer, <choose> chief <TO> 取得 <OR> 首席 </choose> executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes. 
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian <choose> Role <TO> 角色 <OR> Predilection </choose> and Whistleblowing. 
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, <choose> costs <TO> 成本 <OR> Gordon </choose> of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.

His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some <choose> ethnic <TO> 族裔 <OR> 他 </choose> minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.

"A small cloth bag with a handful of diamonds, which is very light and can be held in a hand, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told her experience in Antwerp last <choose> June <TO> 六月 <OR> 、 </choose> to the mainland media. 
She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both <choose> walking <TO> 走路 <OR> 从 </choose> and sleeping. 
Recently, she <choose> sold <TO> 售出 <OR> 心脏病 </choose> the diamond at a 20% price premium and earned two hundred thousand yuan at a time. 
According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither <choose> supplies <TO> 用品 <OR> 持续 </choose> nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamonds should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, the people who carry them shall be classified as smuggling and may be sentenced to jail. 
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th <choose> day <TO> 日 <OR> 继续 </choose> of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place. 
Teresa <choose> Mei <TO> 脂肪 <OR> 梅 </choose> chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that a United Kingdom prime minister chose to go vacation in Switzerland after Margaret Thatcher, according to the United Kingdom newspaper Daily Telegraph. 
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the vacation selection of hotter <choose> places <TO> 地方 <OR> 血栓 </choose> by Blair and Cameron 
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its category number and quantity rank <choose> first <TO> 心脏病 <OR> 第一 </choose> in Anhui Province. 
Hua Jianhui pointed out that this was the first time that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of <choose> vertical <TO> 林达 <OR> 垂直 </choose> administration department and carry out special inquiries.

China's <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 今日 </choose> program kicks off 
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most <choose> energy <TO> 能量 <OR> 会 </choose> efficient to launch the vehicle." 
In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the <choose> ability <TO> 格雷 <OR> 能力 </choose> to find obstacles. 
Currently, the Mars has become the <choose> planet <TO> 行星 <OR> 是 </choose> with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration. 
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a base of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a <choose> second <TO> 第二 <OR> 使 </choose> home for mankind. 
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of <choose> evolution <TO> 去年 <OR> 演化 </choose> to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc. 
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the <choose> Martian <TO> 证据 <OR> 火星 </choose> atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration. 
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with <choose> high <TO> 原 <OR> 高 </choose> uncertainty. 
A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover so that it can <choose> wait <TO> 等待 <OR> 埃里克 </choose> patiently until the departure of dust storms. 
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the <choose> energy <TO> 能源 <OR> 文件 </choose> supply for Mars detection. 
This requires that the detector's sun <choose> wing <TO> 翼 <OR> 这份 </choose> area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction. 
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the <choose> high <TO> 高 <OR> 穆斯林 </choose> speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth. 
The way to detect the Mars is <choose> similar <TO> 相似 <OR> 义务 </choose> to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao. 
Lin Quan <choose> also <TO> 的 <OR> 也 </choose> announced that Hong Peigen, "Deputy Director of the Independent Commission against Corruption", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.

The experience of <choose> Hong <TO> 证实 <OR> 洪 </choose> Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related ill-gotten party assets. 
Zhan Qixian <choose> also <TO> 也 <OR> ， </choose> stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch.

Many NBA players have proved their strength. <choose> But <TO> “ <OR> 但是 </choose> whenever there is progress, there is a setback. 
Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the <choose> Bulls <TO> 公牛 <OR> 几乎 </choose> is not so good as that of the Miami Heat.

Okafor's situation is a bit embarrassing. As the <choose> first <TO> 完整 <OR> 第一 </choose> choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Embiid in the new season. 
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Embiid must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a <choose> position <TO> 位置 <OR> 登记 </choose> in the long array of the 76ers remains a question. 
Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor came from low position attacks. The <choose> ratio <TO> 坚决 <OR> 比例 </choose> is higher than Cousins, Vukcevic and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.

Officials from the United States <choose> Central <TO> 洪涝灾害 <OR> 中央 </choose> Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday. 
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior <choose> policy <TO> 政策 <OR> 省城 </choose> makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States <choose> Central <TO> 8 <OR> 中央 </choose> Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq. 
<choose> But <TO> 但 <OR> 开展 </choose> last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.

The Depressing <choose> Food <TO> 食物 <OR> 休假 </choose> of the Depression, in "A Square Meal" 
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," <choose> Jane <TO> 珍 <OR> ” </choose> Ziegelman said. 
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese <choose> cuisine <TO> 菜 <OR> 瑞士 </choose> in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American <choose> food <TO> 后 <OR> 食品 </choose> in the Great Depression. 
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a <choose> cream <TO> 奶油 <OR> 新 </choose> cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. 
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the <choose> couple <TO> 成员国 <OR> 夫妻 </choose> deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating. 
They were made from an ingredient and a <choose> cheap <TO> 便宜 <OR> 物质 </choose> thing that stretches the ingredient out. 
<choose> Imagine <TO> 想象 <OR> 非遗 </choose> eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner. 
In the years before the Depression, the American table, <choose> especially <TO> 尤其 <OR> 赴 </choose> in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Teams of women cooked for <choose> male <TO> 男 <OR> 加强 </choose> farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
"This was a time when <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> ， </choose> became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a <choose> creamy <TO> 奶油 <OR> 介绍 </choose> coating of sauce. 
Fresh fruit was replaced with <choose> cheaper <TO> 便宜 <OR> 有 </choose> dried fruit. 
<choose> Strange <TO> 国外 <OR> 奇怪 </choose> mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense. 
"It was not a popular addition to the <choose> dinner <TO> 人类 <OR> 晚餐 </choose> table," Mr. Coe said. 
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged <choose> women <TO> 女性 <OR> 几十亿年 </choose> to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes. 
<choose> Especially <TO> 进行 <OR> 尤其 </choose> savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. 
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined <choose> like <TO> 热 <OR> 像 </choose> the millionaire sophisticate he had become. 
"He liked to <choose> eat <TO> 吃 <OR> 火星 </choose> Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said. 
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's <choose> hiring <TO> 聘用 <OR> 和 </choose> of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared." 
The legacy is in our continued focus on <choose> calories <TO> 卡路里 <OR> 设计师 </choose> and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking. 
The <choose> couple <TO> 1 <OR> 夫妻 </choose> said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance. 
"She had a real fear of <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> 探测 </choose> waste," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got <choose> people <TO> % <OR> 人 </choose> sick." 
<choose> Everyone <TO> 大家 <OR> 气动 </choose> reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo. 
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped <choose> walnuts <TO> 核桃 <OR> 探测器 </choose> would help."

NASA climate model: <choose> Venus <TO> 导致 <OR> 金星 </choose> was once habitable 
<choose> Venus <TO> 夏天 <OR> 金星 </choose> was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for <choose> Space <TO> 肌肤 <OR> 太空 </choose> Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists. 
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less <choose> surface <TO> 表面 <OR> 有 </choose> and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
But the latest simulation suggests <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 防晒霜 </choose> could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
<choose> Early <TO> 产品 <OR> 早期 </choose> Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer. 
This warms the surface and produces <choose> rain <TO> 着 <OR> 雨水 </choose> that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
The model produced a story of <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 可 </choose> similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
Though likely once habitable, <choose> Venus <TO> ， <OR> 金星 </choose> was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> ， </choose> we know today. 
Researchers shared the results of their new <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 月 </choose> climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
