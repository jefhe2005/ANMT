28-Year-Old Chef Found <choose> 死 </choose> at San Francisco Mall 
A 28-year-old chef who had <choose> 近日 </choose> moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week. 
<choose> 但 </choose> the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." 
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday <choose> 早上 </choose> was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. 
"We are a <choose> 小 </choose> team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said. 
Our thoughts and <choose> 哀悼 </choose> are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time. 
He was a <choose> 善良 </choose> spirit with a big heart. 
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the <choose> 粗 </choose> that was shining bright every day," he said. 
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract <choose> 交易 </choose> agreed with the BMA. 
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has <choose> 今日 </choose> made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September. 
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the <choose> 投票 </choose> to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended. 
He had told BMA members the <choose> 交易 </choose> was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students. 
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but <choose> 甚至 </choose> higher. 
There is <choose> 也 </choose> an economic motive. 
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has <choose> 近日 </choose> been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides. 
During that time, brand strategists have <choose> 使用 </choose> 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands. 
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion <choose> 安迪 </choose> Murray. 
<choose> 但是 </choose> now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore. 
There are other, smaller brands for <choose> 私人 </choose> banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its <choose> 六 </choose> Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship. 
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and <choose> 退役 </choose> 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career. 
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and <choose> 魅力 </choose> have been drawing fans to the sport for years. 
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the <choose> 最好 </choose> part of 30 years which is great to see. 
He's a lively <choose> 性格 </choose> which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey. 
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he <choose> 也 </choose> survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban. 
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of <choose> 性格 </choose> to defy the doubters and return to his best. 
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's <choose> 信任 </choose> inner circle for many years. 
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and <choose> 交通 </choose> issues. 
<choose> 但是 </choose> the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, <choose> 引述 </choose> on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> 第二 </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional. 
<choose> 但是 </choose> that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev. 
<choose> 神秘 </choose> as fish land in Banff garden 
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing <choose> 竣工 </choose> around each of the bridge's three towers. 
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel <choose> 使用 </choose> just to build this part of the bridge. 
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining <choose> 缺口 </choose> on the north - or landward - side. 
This was <choose> 完成 </choose> by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards. 
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were <choose> 小 </choose> - just a few millimetres either way. 
Biles became the fourth straight American <choose> 女子 </choose> to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever. 
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long <choose> 旅程 </choose> to this moment ended. 
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes <choose> 像 </choose> Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights: 
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of <choose> 志向 </choose> and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen." 
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field <choose> 旅行 </choose> to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force. 
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final <choose> 比分 </choose> - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality. 
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for <choose> 第三 </choose> but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker. 
<choose> 警方 </choose> say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week. 
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, <choose> 胳膊 </choose> and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital. 
The <choose> 孩子 </choose> was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports. 
The other two victims were not in the car and <choose> 警方 </choose> are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter. 
No arrests have been made and <choose> 警察 </choose> are reportedly reviewing surveillance video. 
She is recovering, and <choose> 警察 </choose> are still searching for a suspect. 
This team looks, finally, <choose> 像 </choose> America. 
It also has solidified the black and Latina <choose> 女性 </choose> presence at the top of this sport. 
For the past four years, the number one <choose> 女 </choose> gymnast has been African-American. 
<choose> 但是 </choose> the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
<choose> 大部分 </choose> of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business. 
In September, we will be expanding to <choose> 底特律 </choose> (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport. 
To participate in sport is so important, <choose> 尤其 </choose> for girls. 
The <choose> 首先 </choose> junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours. 
The <choose> 上次 </choose> strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. 
Daniel Mortimer, <choose> 首席 </choose> executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes. 
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian <choose> 角色 </choose> and Whistleblowing. 
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, <choose> 成本 </choose> of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May. 
People who have already have one attack are at a <choose> 更高 </choose> risk of having another. 
PC <choose> 文化 </choose> let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish 
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting <choose> 舞弊 </choose> in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today. 
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that <choose> 警方 </choose> should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters. 
The report even suggests putting indelible <choose> 墨水 </choose> on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice. 
Last year a special election <choose> 法庭 </choose> ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices. 
The <choose> 法庭 </choose> found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia. 
Sir Eric said there was evidence of <choose> 舞弊 </choose> across the country. 
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting <choose> 舞弊 </choose> - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing. 
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the <choose> 投票 </choose> system including bringing your ID to prove who you are 
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, <choose> 尤其 </choose> in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background. 
The report, being considered by Theresa May, <choose> 也 </choose> calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud. 
Use indelible ink on a person's <choose> 手指 </choose> once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice. 
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal <choose> 投票 </choose> envelopes. 
Give <choose> 警方 </choose> powers to set up cordons around polling stations. 
"The election <choose> 法庭 </choose> disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. 
Sir Eric said: "Last year's <choose> 法庭 </choose> ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call. 
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, <choose> 然而 </choose> the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.

Other <choose> 流行 </choose> comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union. 
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been <choose> 被迫 </choose> to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race. 
<choose> 太 </choose> excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.

Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think <choose> 有人 </choose> is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.' 
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another <choose> 女人 </choose> had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.' 
All the <choose> 商品 </choose> in question has been removed from sale. 
How to defend yourself from gun attacks <choose> 使用 </choose> Krav Maga 
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the <choose> 首先 </choose> thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'. 
You then grasp the gun between your <choose> 前臂 </choose> and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.

At the same time, put <choose> 重量 </choose> on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him. 
<choose> 家庭 </choose> of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction

This was a very difficult <choose> 案件 </choose> as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness. 
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall <choose> 警方 </choose> and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.

"A <choose> 小 </choose> cloth bag with a handful of diamonds, which is very light and can be held in a hand, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media. 
She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both <choose> 走路 </choose> and sleeping. 
Recently, she <choose> 售出 </choose> the diamond at a 20% price premium and earned two hundred thousand yuan at a time. 
According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither <choose> 用品 </choose> nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods.

According to foreign media reports, on the 10th <choose> 日 </choose> of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place. 
Teresa <choose> 梅 </choose> chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that a United Kingdom prime minister chose to go vacation in Switzerland after Margaret Thatcher, according to the United Kingdom newspaper Daily Telegraph.

"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most <choose> 能量 </choose> efficient to launch the vehicle." 
In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the <choose> 能力 </choose> to find obstacles. 
Currently, the Mars has become the <choose> 行星 </choose> with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration. 
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a <choose> 基地 </choose> of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind. 
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of <choose> 演化 </choose> to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc. 
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the <choose> 火星 </choose> atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration. 
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with <choose> 高 </choose> uncertainty. 
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the <choose> 能源 </choose> supply for Mars detection. 
This requires that the detector's sun <choose> 翼 </choose> area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction. 
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the <choose> 高 </choose> speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth. 
The way to detect the Mars is <choose> 相似 </choose> to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao.

This toucan, which had its <choose> 喙 </choose> broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life. 
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating <choose> 葡萄 </choose> with a new beak. 
In order to remind people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new <choose> 喙 </choose> color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material. 
The <choose> 喙 </choose> is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support. 
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's <choose> 喙 </choose> is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt. 
Now Gracia can <choose> 使用 </choose> the new beak to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains. 
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with <choose> 血 </choose> covering on its body. 
At that time, its <choose> 喙 </choose> was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying. 
People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its <choose> 生活 </choose> before hurting. 
<choose> 甚至 </choose> the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was also involved in the design of the Gracia beak. 
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual <choose> 喙 </choose> is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak." 
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and fixed it on its <choose> 喙 </choose> with glue." 
<choose> 之前 </choose> installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection. 
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal <choose> 星球 </choose> Channel.

There was <choose> 也 </choose> a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glories for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the newcomers and cultivated a great number of champions.

Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the <choose> 公牛 </choose> is not so good as that of the Miami Heat. 
The backcourt <choose> 射程 </choose> of he and Rondo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite congested. 
Okafor's situation is a bit embarrassing. As the <choose> 第一 </choose> choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Embiid in the new season.

Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor came from low position attacks. The <choose> 比例 </choose> is higher than Cousins, Vukcevic and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.

Fernando suddenly flipped pass the ball in front of the goal after a retreat in a one-to-two confrontation on his right wing. Kardec was put down by a swoop of Lei Tenglong. The <choose> 裁判 </choose> sentenced a spot kick and showed a yellow card to Lei Tenglong. 
Just at the beginning of the next half, Fernando won a free kick on the right side with an abrupt breakthrough. It was a <choose> 可惜 </choose> that he kicked the ball too high in small angle and missed the goal. 
One minute later, Fernando showed his long-range raid capability on the right again. His pursuer Yu Dabao fouled and <choose> 也 </choose> got a yellow card. 
Yilmaz made a forceful breakthrough on the penalty area line, but tumbled when Zheng Yourong stretched a leg to stop him, which led the <choose> 裁判 </choose> to determine a penalty. Yilmaz kicked a successful penalty goal, as a result the score board was: Lifan 2:1 Beijing Guoan.

<choose> 丹 </choose> Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands. 
Kyle <choose> 布朗 </choose> put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half. 
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this <choose> 一天 </choose> when diagnosed with cancer.

You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a <choose> 角色 </choose> befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting. 
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie <choose> 朱 </choose> said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before." 
Ms. <choose> 朱 </choose> criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat. 
Other observers <choose> 分享 </choose> her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered. 
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a <choose> 私人 </choose> company. 
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company <choose> 近期 </choose> hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally. 
For her part, Ms. <choose> 朱 </choose> said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K." 
Officials from the United States <choose> 中央 </choose> Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday. 
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in <choose> 中央 </choose> Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces. 
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States <choose> 中央 </choose> Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq. 
General Austin <choose> 退役 </choose> in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel. 
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field <choose> 曲棍球 </choose> team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.

On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a <choose> 反手 </choose> shot from close in. 
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the <choose> 比分 </choose> 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.

The Depressing <choose> 食物 </choose> of the Depression, in "A Square Meal" 
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," <choose> 珍 </choose> Ziegelman said. 
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese <choose> 菜 </choose> in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a <choose> 奶油 </choose> cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. 
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the <choose> 夫妻 </choose> deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating. 
There was <choose> 花生 </choose> loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf. 
They were made from an ingredient and a <choose> 便宜 </choose> thing that stretches the ingredient out. 
<choose> 想象 </choose> eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner. 
"It must have sat in your stomach <choose> 像 </choose> lead," he said. 
In the years before the Depression, the American table, <choose> 尤其 </choose> in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Teams of women cooked for <choose> 男 </choose> farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
"This was a time when <choose> 食物 </choose> became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a <choose> 奶油 </choose> coating of sauce. 
Fresh fruit was replaced with <choose> 便宜 </choose> dried fruit. 
<choose> 奇怪 </choose> mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense. 
"It was not a popular addition to the <choose> 晚餐 </choose> table," Mr. Coe said. 
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged <choose> 女性 </choose> to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes. 
<choose> 尤其 </choose> savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. 
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined <choose> 像 </choose> the millionaire sophisticate he had become. 
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's <choose> 聘用 </choose> of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared." 
The legacy is in our continued focus on <choose> 卡路里 </choose> and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking. 
The <choose> 夫妻 </choose> said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance. 
"She had a real fear of <choose> 食物 </choose> waste," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got <choose> 人 </choose> sick." 
<choose> 大家 </choose> reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo. 
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped <choose> 核桃 </choose> would help."

NASA climate model: <choose> 金星 </choose> was once habitable 
<choose> 金星 </choose> was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for <choose> 太空 </choose> Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists. 
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less <choose> 表面 </choose> and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
But the <choose> 最新 </choose> simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
<choose> 早期 </choose> Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer. 
This warms the surface and produces <choose> 雨水 </choose> that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
The model produced a story of <choose> 金星 </choose> similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
Though likely once habitable, <choose> 金星 </choose> was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the <choose> 金星 </choose> we know today. 
Researchers shared the results of their new <choose> 金星 </choose> climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

The <choose> 最新 </choose> mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster. 
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to <choose> 星球 </choose> formation. 
The <choose> 最新 </choose> catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars. 
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical <choose> 模型 </choose> of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull. 
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, <choose> 不久 </choose> to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
