But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would <choose> want <TO> , <OR> wollen </choose> to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> bergauf </choose> body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> gerichtsmedizinische </choose> San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> Ermittlungen </choose> victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago. 
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would <choose> want <TO> wollen <OR> Monaten </choose> to hurt his younger brother. 
He was a kind spirit with a <choose> big <TO> großen <OR> des </choose> heart. 
<choose> His <TO> . <OR> seiner </choose> way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said. 
He <choose> never <TO> nie <OR> Frank </choose> wanted to be in any kind of altercation. 
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining <choose> bright <TO> sich <OR> hell </choose> every day," he said.

Jennifer Aniston: I'm <choose> always <TO> immer <OR> teilnehmen </choose> pigeonholed 
That is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly <choose> clear <TO> klar <OR> der </choose> in an interview. 
"I'm <choose> always <TO> er <OR> immer </choose> pigeonholed, or labelled by someone who has little, if anything, to do with me and reality." 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> . </choose> question of whether she wants children makes her livid: "We women do not need to be married or have children to feel fulfilled," the Hollywood star says.

"It wasn't a good experience," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> Aniston </choose> Langer. 
The <choose> German <TO> mir <OR> deutsche </choose> Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event.

On Saturday, he met the <choose> first <TO> ersten <OR> diese </choose> person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen. 
"This award means a lot to me," <choose> said <TO> 47 <OR> sagt </choose> Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment." 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> dem </choose> two-time US master's champion was inaugurated into the "Hall of Fame for German Sport" on Saturday, along with 15 other outstanding sportspeople.

<choose> Both <TO> sowohl <OR> In </choose> Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement. 
<choose> But <TO> jedoch <OR> . </choose> the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue. 
If in doubt, Trump <choose> wants <TO> will <OR> die </choose> the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations. 
He <choose> would <TO> wäre <OR> Seine </choose> do things totally differently, Trump says. 
This <choose> would <TO> würden <OR> mit </choose> increase taxes for the rich, she says. 
The <choose> Democratic <TO> Für <OR> demokratische </choose> candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War. 
Consequently, Trump <choose> could <TO> für <OR> könnten </choose> lead to discussions within the party. 
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA <choose> back <TO> Minuten <OR> wieder </choose> up. 
Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he <choose> wants <TO> will <OR> Tempo </choose> to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty. 
On the other hand, Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies, saying: "One country will <choose> become <TO> kein <OR> werden </choose> the superpower of renewable energies, and create millions of jobs." 
But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of <choose> international <TO> internationalen <OR> endete </choose> trade agreements as well. 
Neither <choose> want <TO> wollen <OR> Deutschlands </choose> to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement. 
At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect <choose> American <TO> amerikanische <OR> schwang </choose> jobs better. 
<choose> She <TO> sie <OR> . </choose> wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour. 
Trump is on one side, wanting to <choose> relieve <TO> entlasten <OR> Der </choose> the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth. 
Seeking refuge: "Every refugee woman has dealt with <choose> sexual <TO> sexueller <OR> es </choose> violence" 
<choose> For <TO> für <OR> the </choose> women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life. 
<choose> Four <TO> vier <OR> . </choose> women are sitting in a large kitchen. 
His mother <choose> stares <TO> starrt <OR> ist </choose> at the tabletop. 
She is the field manager for Condrobs, a provider of <choose> social <TO> soziale <OR> Engagement </choose> assistance within Bavaria. One of the issues she deals with is refugee women. 
They live in the north of Munich, in <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> Langer </choose> of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone. 
There are no men - not <choose> even <TO> das <OR> auch </choose> male visitors. 
"I'm not exaggerating when I <choose> say <TO> sagt <OR> 15 </choose> that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr. 
In their home countries, they experienced <choose> sexual <TO> sexueller <OR> Leichtathleten </choose> violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution. 
"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a <choose> sexual <TO> dieser <OR> sexuelle </choose> act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr. 
Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommodation, <choose> says <TO> , <OR> sagt </choose> Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region. 
In a study <choose> published <TO> veröffentlicht <OR> Abstand </choose> on behalf of the Committee, it was stated that "it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation." 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> Trumps </choose> extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich. 
It would be <choose> easy <TO> leicht <OR> als </choose> to open a second house. 
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal <choose> agreed <TO> vereinbart <OR> . </choose> with the BMA. 
It was rejected by 58% of its members who <choose> voted <TO> abgestimmt <OR> sagt </choose> in the ballot. 
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had <choose> remained <TO> geblieben <OR> selber </choose> "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected. 
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a <choose> formal <TO> und <OR> formalen </choose> request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September. 
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, <choose> resigned <TO> hat <OR> trat </choose> following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended. 
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month <choose> long <TO> lang <OR> Deshalb </choose> war of words and economic sanctions. 
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his <choose> Turkish <TO> türkischen <OR> Infrastruktur </choose> counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most. 
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was <choose> hardly <TO> und <OR> kaum </choose> oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards. 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - <choose> five <TO> fünf <OR> kündigt </choose> times, according to one report. 
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a <choose> Russian <TO> strikt <OR> russischen </choose> fighter plane on the Syrian border. 
The offence was <choose> even <TO> sogar <OR> also </choose> greater, coming from a supposed friend. 
Russian <choose> public <TO> öffentliche <OR> der </choose> opinion has also turned since November. 
All of a sudden, it <choose> seemed <TO> die <OR> schien </choose> like Turks were to blame for everything. 
Russia <choose> could <TO> konnte <OR> geschützten </choose> claim a victory of sorts. 
<choose> First <TO> . <OR> erster </choose> and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup. 
There is also an <choose> economic <TO> wirtschaftliche <OR> es </choose> motive. 
Russian sanctions have hit hard - <choose> particularly <TO> insbesondere <OR> der </choose> the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year. 
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be <choose> relieved <TO> erleichtert <OR> beide </choose> when flights eventually resume. 
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once <choose> Turkish <TO> türkischen <OR> schützen </choose> agricultural imports are permitted again. 
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the <choose> attempted <TO> versuchten <OR> etwa </choose> coup. 
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that <choose> feel <TO> ein <OR> fühlen </choose> rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces. 
Still, <choose> despite <TO> auf <OR> trotz </choose> the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences. 
Turkey's president <choose> deliberately <TO> absichtlich <OR> der </choose> avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them. 
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is <choose> surely <TO> sicherlich <OR> Wachstum </choose> better that the two leaders are at least talking again. 
<choose> The <TO> , <OR> dem </choose> brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive. 
It has retreated from them <choose> since <TO> seitdem <OR> steht </choose> it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. 
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will <choose> get <TO> erhalten <OR> hat </choose> more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
Each one of those brands will <choose> stand <TO> stehen <OR> Gewalt </choose> for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands. 
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd <choose> said <TO> gesagt <OR> ankommen </choose> we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there. 
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I <choose> think <TO> denke <OR> Ein </choose> you're seeing a lot of change. 
We can bring those brands back up again, so I <choose> think <TO> Küche <OR> denke </choose> the time is right.

Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for <choose> many <TO> viele <OR> vier </choose> years. 
Mr Ivanov's deputy <choose> since <TO> seit <OR> wenigen </choose> 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor. 
<choose> Later <TO> aufgemacht <OR> später </choose> he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian). 
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to <choose> leave <TO> verlassen <OR> offiziell </choose> the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him. 
Sergei Ivanov has <choose> long <TO> leben <OR> lange </choose> been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB. 
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with <choose> great <TO> keine <OR> große </choose> scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, <choose> quoted <TO> Die <OR> zitiert </choose> on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years. 
Mr Ivanov <choose> took <TO> , <OR> nahm </choose> up the post in December 2011. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> second <TO> zweiter <OR> ihre </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.

This was done by pulling the <choose> northern <TO> freiwillig <OR> nördlichen </choose> approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards. 
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be <choose> pulled <TO> gezogen <OR> ist </choose> up a gradient of about 3%.

Firstly, there is the question of who is <choose> actually <TO> Fehlt <OR> eigentlich </choose> going to build the low-cost homes? 
However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to <choose> build <TO> allem <OR> bauen </choose> on private ground?" 
A new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes, which will <choose> cost <TO> kosten <OR> gibt </choose> millions, and which still needs to be financed, will trigger concerns.

<choose> But <TO> aber <OR> JDC </choose> how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years? 
In addition, thought must be given to putting homes <choose> back <TO> zurück <OR> die </choose> into a price maintenance scenario. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> BMA </choose> problem could be solved in one fell swoop. 
Around 1800 homes <choose> could <TO> könnte <OR> haben </choose> then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> die </choose> only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it. 
This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step <choose> back <TO> wieder <OR> : </choose> from the target of "blending". 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> des </choose> Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions. 
<choose> But <TO> . <OR> doch </choose> that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise. 
That teenagers and children do not get <choose> outside <TO> , <OR> draußen </choose> to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade. 
Screen time was <choose> initially <TO> anfangs <OR> würde </choose> limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones. 
So it is <choose> great <TO> toll <OR> Russland </choose> to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive. 
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first <choose> created <TO> erschaffen <OR> Krise </choose> for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).

<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Handschlag </choose> company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels. 
<choose> Many <TO> viele <OR> Aber </choose> public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable. 
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to <choose> complain <TO> einem <OR> beschweren </choose> about. 
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could <choose> previously <TO> früher <OR> Ich </choose> track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does. 
<choose> The <TO> , <OR> der </choose> novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course. 
<choose> However <TO> jedoch <OR> nächsten </choose> because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

<choose> One <TO> einer <OR> Russland </choose> last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations. 
Anything less than heading <choose> back <TO> Monate <OR> zurück </choose> to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.

Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was <choose> parked <TO> geparkt <OR> Reiseveranstalter </choose> in a driveway, authorities said. 
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then <choose> fled <TO> einen <OR> floh </choose> in another vehicle, the report states. 
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> Woche </choose> of the adult victims. 
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two <choose> predominantly <TO> vorwiegend <OR> folgendermaßen </choose> Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.

<choose> The <TO> der <OR> keine </choose> grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital. 
The boy is listed in <choose> critical <TO> anderes <OR> kritisch </choose> condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries. 
Family tells the station he is <choose> expected <TO> voraussichtlich <OR> , </choose> to recover. 
He was set to <choose> start <TO> beginnen <OR> ) </choose> first grade at a local elementary school. 
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in <choose> critical <TO> kritischen <OR> diese </choose> condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia. 
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in <choose> critical <TO> kritischen <OR> Arbeit </choose> condition, the station reports. 
The other <choose> two <TO> diese <OR> zwei </choose> victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter. 
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to <choose> different <TO> verschiedenen <OR> bei </choose> assault style weapons, littered the scene. 
So it <choose> appears <TO> scheint <OR> bringt </choose> that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station. 
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were <choose> also <TO> auch <OR> . </choose> struck. 
First, I have been to <choose> every <TO> jeder <OR> Gewinn </choose> Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant. 
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been <choose> inspiring <TO> der <OR> inspirierend </choose> so many young girls of color. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Pat </choose> make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud. 
It also has solidified the black and Latina <choose> female <TO> weibliche <OR> dreimalige </choose> presence at the top of this sport. 
For the past four years, the number <choose> one <TO> eins <OR> ist </choose> female gymnast has been African-American. 
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, <choose> yet <TO> doch <OR> Jahren </choose> masterful gymnastics routines. 
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's <choose> last <TO> 20.000 <OR> letzte </choose> year coaching. 
But the reality is that gymnastics is an <choose> expensive <TO> teurer <OR> den </choose> sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes <choose> since <TO> seitdem <OR> rekordbrechenden </choose> they started in gymnastics. 
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless <choose> young <TO> neunmalige <OR> jungen </choose> girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. 
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 <choose> urban <TO> urbane <OR> der </choose> youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions. 
It is the inspiration of this team that will send <choose> thousands <TO> tausende <OR> es </choose> of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great. 
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so <choose> many <TO> Botschafter <OR> viele </choose> young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> end <TO> vor <OR> beenden </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it. 
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be <choose> damaging <TO> schädlich <OR> in </choose> for staff and patients. 
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement <choose> last <TO> letzte <OR> ist </choose> night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly." 
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be <choose> made <TO> gemacht <OR> feierte </choose> and time is running out. 
<choose> This <TO> Frankie <OR> das </choose> is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open. 
If he does not then junior doctors are <choose> clear <TO> deutlich <OR> war </choose> that they are prepared to take further industrial action. 
The <choose> last <TO> letzte <OR> einen </choose> strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> end <TO> beenden <OR> Sperre </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials. 
The BMA <choose> wants <TO> möchte <OR> gesagt </choose> better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract. 
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on <choose> already <TO> bereits <OR> Ivanov </choose> stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families." 
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded <choose> positively <TO> positiv <OR> Stabschef </choose> to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.

Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was <choose> removed <TO> entfernt <OR> habe </choose> from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report 
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so <choose> bad <TO> lächelnden <OR> schlimm </choose> that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters. 
Currently, a voter <choose> merely <TO> lediglich <OR> Moskau </choose> has to state their name and address.

His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and <choose> young <TO> junge <OR> . </choose> people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background. 
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, <choose> including <TO> einschließlich <OR> sich </choose> banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."

We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on <choose> Social <TO> der <OR> sozialen </choose> media. 
That said, they were inappropriate and an <choose> unfortunate <TO> unglücklich <OR> . </choose> choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said. 
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and <choose> attempted <TO> und <OR> versuchte </choose> to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack. 
'I <choose> would <TO> bis <OR> würde </choose> like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'

'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, <choose> bold <TO> frech <OR> Constructors </choose> as brass.' 
She did the same with three more pairs before <choose> finally <TO> endlich <OR> der </choose> deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.

It's a <choose> dangerous <TO> gefährlicher <OR> . </choose> world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you. 
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at <choose> close <TO> nahe <OR> heikle </choose> range. 
<choose> Whether <TO> ob <OR> ca </choose> you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger. 
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you <choose> twist <TO> jeder <OR> verdrehen </choose> the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him. 
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a <choose> similar <TO> ähnlich <OR> alles </choose> technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire. 
At the same time, put weight on the gun and <choose> punch <TO> sein <OR> schlagen </choose> the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him. 
But remember that the <choose> safest <TO> Fischerboot <OR> sichersten </choose> way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.

He <choose> said <TO> : <OR> sagt </choose> in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.' 
There's <choose> nothing <TO> nichts <OR> Boots </choose> more dirty than that! 
I'm not going to lick anything because it's <choose> disgusting <TO> ekelhaft <OR> . </choose> in there. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> seine </choose> company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems. 
We did a lot of <choose> crazy <TO> verrückte <OR> in </choose> brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian." 
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's <choose> linked <TO> bekommen <OR> verknüpft </choose> to the immune system. 
I also <choose> think <TO> Täter <OR> denke </choose> the film shows we have a great sense of humour! 
Naturally some things were <choose> easier <TO> einfacher <OR> die </choose> to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough. 
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents <choose> associated <TO> assoziierten <OR> verletzt </choose> lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.

In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the <choose> Syrian <TO> syrische <OR> . </choose> border. 
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation <choose> since <TO> seit <OR> Sprungpferd </choose> President Barack Obama nominated him in March. 
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not <choose> spoken <TO> Mühelos <OR> gesprochen </choose> to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating. 
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team <choose> would <TO> Boden <OR> würde </choose> not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick. 
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of <choose> Republican <TO> republikanischen <OR> Auf </choose> presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
He said Trump is <choose> unfit <TO> endlich <OR> ungeeignet </choose> for office. 
But <choose> instead <TO> anstelle <OR> Welt </choose> of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar. 
Treats president Steve Shaw <choose> told <TO> Raisman <OR> erzählte </choose> us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men." 
"We need to get <choose> back <TO> wieder <OR> insgesamt </choose> to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> , </choose> Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people to arrive at short notice in search of protection, fleeing from Turkey to Germany. 
In the medium term, this <choose> could <TO> könnten <OR> Erfolg </choose> even grow to "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, President of the association. 
The crackdown instigated by <choose> Turkish <TO> türkischen <OR> Übungen </choose> President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to Germany. 
"In the short term I'm expecting ten thousand, in the medium term a few hundred thousand people coming from Turkey looking for protection in Germany, if the Erdogan regime <choose> continues <TO> weiter <OR> dem </choose> to antagonise minorities and democratic opposition," said the President of the Association, Ali Toprak, to "Die Welt" newspaper on Friday. 
A few months ago the government initiated punitive action against Kurdish strongholds - and as a result, 500,000 Kurds are already on the run <choose> within <TO> innerhalb <OR> und </choose> Turkey. 
Many will want to seek a <choose> new <TO> der <OR> neu </choose> start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Turkey. 
"They are the last big minority in Turkey: the Christian Armenians and the Greeks have <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> ihres </choose> been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> abgestimmt </choose> German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad. 
As the newspaper reports, using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup Turks were the largest group granted asylum in Germany on the grounds of <choose> political <TO> politischer <OR> Zufall </choose> persecution. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> wurde </choose> way things had been going was simply ridiculous: summer holidays, heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another. 
Until 4 September 2016, election day and the last day of the holidays, people in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern <choose> must <TO> muss <OR> lange </choose> put up with one more election without the people being consulted. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> Bild </choose> heated phase, if that can be said at all, has already begun. 
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now <choose> clearly <TO> klar <OR> 15,433 </choose> behind the CDU, according to polls. 
Sellering, 66 years <choose> old <TO> alt <OR> sanft </choose> and head of the parliament since 2008, pursued a rather inconspicuous election campaign, as can be seen from his posters. 
Her refugee policies, her "we can manage it" have accelerated the rise of the far-right, he believes - which will <choose> probably <TO> war <OR> vermutlich </choose> cost him his job. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> Dieses </choose> CDU and its top-level candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time. 
"The majority <choose> probably <TO> wahrscheinlich <OR> warf </choose> came from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained to the NDR recently. 
According to Kokert, that will only <choose> play <TO> spiele <OR> Bedeutung </choose> a "minor role". 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Auto </choose> Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region, and will have to work hard to connect with the people. 
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had a <choose> clear <TO> klar <OR> die </choose> victory over the CDU (35.6 percent versus 22 percent). 
Apart from that, the <choose> Greens <TO> grüne <OR> Einfahrt </choose> are searching out local voters among the holidaymakers. 
At the start of the week, the construction site <choose> could <TO> konnte <OR> die </choose> be moved southwards in line with plans, marking the half-way point, and everything is expected to be completed by October. 
<choose> The <TO> neun <OR> das </choose> obligingness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute driveways. 
Since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday, and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened, and the link to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation <choose> within <TO> Es <OR> innerhalb </choose> the town has improved. 
"There were some serious complaints made," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> aus </choose> Florian King, deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> , </choose> commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either. 
"There were considerable infringements," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> verstarb </choose> King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on. 
<choose> Two <TO> zwei <OR> Maleah </choose> to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> mit </choose> fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone. 
Bars and restaurants <choose> along <TO> entlang <OR> vor </choose> the road had been the hardest hit. 
If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go, politicians <choose> would <TO> sowie <OR> wäre </choose> have reacted differently. 
Instead, when Göhner asked the government's president, Jörg Schmidt, if there would be <choose> financial <TO> finanziellen <OR> Es </choose> compensation, the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment. 
Göhner <choose> knows <TO> weiß <OR> Picciuto </choose> of other districts where people have acted more generously. 
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> seine </choose> when revealing his new security package. 
Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed <choose> within <TO> innerhalb <OR> schaffe </choose> the parties. 
<choose> After <TO> nicht <OR> nach </choose> the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany. 
One thing was already known, announced, heralded: <choose> The <TO> das <OR> . </choose> fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> eingelassen </choose> call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise. 
To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove <choose> German <TO> deutschen <OR> erkennen </choose> passports from jihadis with dual citizenship. 
"They will be <choose> difficult <TO> schwierige <OR> so </choose> issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician. 
De Maizière also <choose> presented <TO> präsentiert <OR> das </choose> a few new ideas. 
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or <choose> deliberately <TO> laufen <OR> bewusst </choose> throw away their papers to conceal their identity. 
Some of it is politically and <choose> legally <TO> rechtlich <OR> krabbeln </choose> tricky. 
Some of it <choose> also <TO> kann <OR> auch </choose> seems half-baked, and leaves questions to be answered. 
Yes, de Maizière says, it is <choose> important <TO> spielen <OR> wichtig </choose> to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism. 
And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - <choose> even <TO> hat <OR> auch </choose> during election season. 
De Maizière is <choose> also <TO> auch <OR> '' </choose> trying to strike a conciliatory note here. 
But the SPD is <choose> also <TO> auch <OR> -- </choose> currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape itself.

Volkswagen's deliveries were more restrained in the <choose> second <TO> zweite <OR> Prognosen </choose> half of the year. 
<choose> Thanks <TO> mit <OR> dank </choose> to its number of brands and some well-functioning markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year, despite the diesel scandal. 
In addition, some key markets saw "changed <choose> economic <TO> wirtschaftliche <OR> ständig </choose> climates", which led to fewer purchases. 
In the USA, where the emissions scandal <choose> first <TO> wird <OR> zuerst </choose> began, the books are once again in the red. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> weiß </choose> Chinese market is a source of great support for VW. 
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time period, coming to a <choose> global <TO> weltweit <OR> schon </choose> total of 5.904 million. 
<choose> After <TO> nach <OR> wurden </choose> modification, the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is "as good as a guarantee" but would not talk of an actual "guarantee", as was mentioned on Friday in corporate circles. 
<choose> Legal <TO> besser <OR> juristische </choose> intricacies are the reason for this. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> besser </choose> Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place. 
"Deviations will not be accepted," explained Alexander Dobrindt (CDU), the Federal Minister for Transport, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> . </choose> to the Ministry. 
Volkswagen believes that the broad term "guarantee" could see customers returning to the workshop with motor damage six months after the modification - and being able to blame this on the <choose> new <TO> neue <OR> Heftige </choose> software, even if the damage had nothing at all to do with it. 
The Raffeisen Bank in Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from <choose> wealthy <TO> reichen <OR> auszurufen </choose> savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so. 
<choose> From <TO> von <OR> des </choose> September, the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day-to-day account to pay this fee. 
"In the future, any subsequent 100,000 euros will <choose> cost <TO> John <OR> kosten </choose> 400 euros a year," Paul said. 
The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring <choose> significant <TO> Mike <OR> erhebliche </choose> costs". 
It would be "impossible" for them to bear these costs "on a <choose> permanent <TO> Samstag <OR> dauerhaft </choose> basis, from a business perspective". 
Michael Kemmer, managing director of the banking association, said: "We are not expecting that private customers will all have to <choose> pay <TO> 3 <OR> bezahlen </choose> fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for that". 
Famous actors, sportspeople and enterpreneurs <choose> live <TO> wohnen <OR> Nähe </choose> in the region. 
Spokesperson Ernst <choose> said <TO> sagte <OR> in </choose> that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria "was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their expenses". 
<choose> The <TO> Flüsse <OR> dem </choose> President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June that "the threshold for tipping into the red in terms of private customers is very, very high". 
It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to <choose> keep <TO> behalten <OR> bereits </choose> their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%). 
While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by <choose> independent <TO> unabhängige <OR> Südwesten </choose> sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain. 
I'd <choose> probably <TO> Gloster <OR> vermutlich </choose> ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation. 
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, <choose> one <TO> einen <OR> das </choose> woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours. 
These records, <choose> pictured <TO> dass <OR> abgebildet </choose> above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls. 
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his <choose> disposable <TO> verfügbaren <OR> strömte </choose> income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint. 
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, <choose> early <TO> frühen <OR> Taille </choose> 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says. 
He has, <choose> however, <TO> allerdings <OR> Seine </choose> noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records. 
According to Wez, some <choose> older <TO> älteren <OR> sagte </choose> customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular. 
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the <choose> familiar <TO> vertrauten <OR> Nothelfer </choose> record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories. 
"We're <choose> like <TO> wie <OR> zögen </choose> their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> vollgesogen </choose> poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player. 
At this stage of the news report, I would <choose> probably <TO> vermutlich <OR> und </choose> be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations. 
"Someone <choose> came <TO> kam <OR> dass </choose> in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.

A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> an </choose> shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living. 
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had <choose> argued <TO> argumentierten <OR> Schießerei </choose> the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> in </choose> Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks. 
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals <choose> offered <TO> Jungen <OR> angeboten </choose> by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp. 
They argued the <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> . </choose> shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need. 
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> Großmutter </choose> shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable." 
<choose> One <TO> eine <OR> kann </choose> of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.

<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> Anerkennung </choose> European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy.

The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months <choose> thanks <TO> dank <OR> einer </choose> to an improved situation in terms of orders. 
<choose> Singing <TO> singt <OR> . </choose> has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly. 
Singing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reasons, <choose> says <TO> sagt <OR> vorläufige </choose> Erhard Hackler from the German Association for the Elderly. 
By <choose> regularly <TO> über <OR> regelmäßige </choose> spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts. 
<choose> Social <TO> soziale <OR> lässt </choose> and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people. 
This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a <choose> controlled <TO> kontrollierte <OR> Lutfur </choose> manner. 
Singing often has a really <choose> special <TO> der <OR> besondere </choose> effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations. 
For <choose> older <TO> älteren <OR> zu </choose> generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains. 
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in <choose> older <TO> , <OR> älteren </choose> people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth. 
Song texts, and melodies in particular, can <choose> even <TO> selbst <OR> Wahlen </choose> be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past. 
<choose> Concentrating <TO> konzentrieren <OR> Wähler </choose> on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge. 
In particular, older people who live alone can <choose> practice <TO> üben <OR> ihre </choose> how to focus on people other than themselves. 
Being able to show yourself that by practising for a <choose> long <TO> Whistleblower <OR> lange </choose> time, you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength. 
If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - <choose> even <TO> auch <OR> dass </choose> if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests. 
You're not <choose> singing <TO> singt <OR> , </choose> by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing, who'll hear if a note's out here or there? 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> der </choose> elderly have many options when looking for the right fit, says Hackler. 
If <choose> someone <TO> jemand <OR> amtierende </choose> you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them. 
To their surprise, the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected - but, compared to their female counterparts, they <choose> always <TO> Rassissmus- <OR> immer </choose> acted the same way.

There were another two explosions early on Friday morning, with another person killed, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> , </choose> to the authorities. 
<choose> According <TO> 2012 <OR> laut </choose> to the authorities, the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police's territory. 
It is too early to speculate on <choose> possible <TO> Doppelgängerin <OR> möglichen </choose> motives, he says - however, it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> verglichen </choose> Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country. 
"It is just local sabotage, <choose> limited <TO> begrenzte <OR> , </choose> to particular areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok. 
Over the past few days, the authorities have <choose> received <TO> aufweist <OR> erhalten </choose> notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for. 
The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security <choose> around <TO> athletischen <OR> rund </choose> important governmental buildings, along with airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife districts.

"In terms of the "Identitäre Bewegung" movement, we can <choose> see <TO> sehen <OR> Rest </choose> clear indicators of efforts against the free, democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, to the German press agency in Berlin.

<choose> That <TO> das <OR> als </choose> is frightening. 
"This means that many people have committed crimes who <choose> previously <TO> vorher <OR> ab </choose> paid the far-right no heed, who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by far-right sensationalism".

On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but <choose> according <TO> jedes <OR> laut </choose> to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.

The <choose> interim <TO> vorläufige <OR> Darmbakterien </choose> report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State. 
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees <choose> American <TO> im <OR> amerikanischen </choose> military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia. 
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders <choose> typically <TO> typischerweise <OR> die </choose> provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said. 
"What <choose> happened <TO> geschehen <OR> Von </choose> at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> ablehnte </choose> 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces. 
For example, a Centcom official stated <choose> publicly <TO> öffentlich <OR> Probeabstrich </choose> that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015. 
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, <choose> remains <TO> . <OR> bleibt </choose> under the control of the Islamic State. 
<choose> The <TO> betrug <OR> die </choose> report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues. 
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an <choose> overly <TO> finnische <OR> übermäßig </choose> insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement. 
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they <choose> found <TO> gefunden <OR> Film </choose> no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative." 
Last August, <choose> The <TO> Schmutzigeres <OR> den </choose> New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts. 
The investigation has repercussions <choose> beyond <TO> hinaus <OR> ekelhaft </choose> the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials). 
<choose> But <TO> Vitamin <OR> jedoch </choose> last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots. 
<choose> The <TO> Neue <OR> den </choose> critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion. 
Mr. Hooker <choose> also <TO> auch <OR> gleichzeitig </choose> played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence. 
<choose> But <TO> jedoch <OR> wird </choose> the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.

One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first <choose> two <TO> zwei <OR> für </choose> goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0. 
Here is what she does know: <choose> The <TO> dem <OR> Film </choose> Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.

<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> haben </choose> first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin. 
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing <choose> last <TO> letzten <OR> Umfrage </choose> among 12 teams at the London Games. 
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., <choose> first <TO> vor <OR> erste </choose> picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.

India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the <choose> third <TO> , <OR> dritte </choose> period, when Bam took charge. 
She made a long run with the ball down the <choose> left <TO> linke <OR> vor </choose> side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead. 
Melissa Gonzalez added the <choose> final <TO> finale <OR> klaffende </choose> goal midway through the fourth period.

But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, <choose> let <TO> lassen <OR> `` </choose> me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline. 
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that <choose> many <TO> nicht <OR> viele </choose> I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all. 
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in <choose> part <TO> Ruf <OR> teilweise </choose> because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics. 
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the <choose> two <TO> zwei <OR> und </choose> sports it essentially combines.

<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Cannabis </choose> last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole. 
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the <choose> new <TO> neue <OR> , </choose> commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty. 
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it <choose> recently <TO> bei <OR> kürzlich </choose> said it closed that base.

Donald Trump Explains <choose> His <TO> seine <OR> Zimmerwände </choose> Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm" 
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the <choose> latest <TO> letzte <OR> nicht </choose> controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> die </choose> clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public. 
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to <choose> explain <TO> erklären <OR> , </choose> remarks that he might not mean. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> tieffliegender </choose> post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge. 
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to <choose> help <TO> helfen <OR> Luftstreitkräfte </choose> Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> dass </choose> latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers. 
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to <choose> return <TO> über <OR> zurück </choose> to that subject. 
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals <choose> would <TO> der <OR> würden </choose> come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring. 
In late July, after he <choose> drew <TO> in <OR> zog </choose> widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic." 
The approach <choose> allows <TO> erlaubt <OR> es </choose> Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed. 
"I think it's a pattern of him testing <choose> certain <TO> an <OR> bestimmte </choose> messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates. 
<choose> But <TO> als <OR> aber </choose> I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses. 
While Mr. Trump <choose> generally <TO> generell <OR> befindliche </choose> tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor. 
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly <choose> stand <TO> stehen <OR> fliegen </choose> up for him no matter how provocative his remarks. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the <choose> former <TO> Teil <OR> ehemaliger </choose> New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday. 
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, <choose> political <TO> politische <OR> gegen </choose> commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State. 
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being <choose> biased <TO> ersten <OR> voreingenommen </choose> against him. 
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who <choose> try <TO> versuchen <OR> Tage </choose> to figure him out and said, "They can't!" 
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is <choose> unfit <TO> verzichten <OR> ungeeignet </choose> to be president. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> Goalie </choose> store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> von </choose> artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop." 
A revived Verb Cafe <choose> opened <TO> und <OR> öffnete </choose> last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location. 
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a <choose> similar <TO> meisten <OR> ähnlich </choose> unpretentious vibe. 
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a <choose> new <TO> neue <OR> den </choose> outpost, he said he was excited to do it. 
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, <choose> kept <TO> Co. <OR> behielt </choose> a lot of things the same.

Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she <choose> would <TO> würde <OR> Janeiro </choose> still make the trek. 
After Verb closed, she said, she <choose> gave <TO> gab <OR> Zhang </choose> up drinking coffee for a while. 
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, <choose> instead <TO> anstelle <OR> . </choose> of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition. 
"Quarter past seven, <choose> every <TO> Mizutani <OR> jeden </choose> day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said. 
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he <choose> wanted <TO> wollte <OR> beiden </choose> to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu. 
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, <choose> using <TO> Einzel-Titel <OR> mit </choose> the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient. 
And Greenpoint's traditional <choose> Polish <TO> polnischen <OR> aus </choose> residents have embraced the cafe as well. 
One of these new customers <choose> translated <TO> übersetzt <OR> keine </choose> the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome. 
A local juice spot <choose> wants <TO> bis <OR> möchte </choose> to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee. 
For many customers, a <choose> new <TO> gesagt <OR> neues </choose> Verb to get their old favorites is enough. 
When the <choose> new <TO> neuen <OR> mit </choose> space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming. 
<choose> The <TO> unerwartet <OR> der </choose> Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal" 
Mr. Coe's <choose> last <TO> seinem <OR> letztes </choose> book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Showing some <choose> culinary <TO> kulinarische <OR> die </choose> solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929. 
In the years before the Depression, the <choose> American <TO> amerikanischen <OR> nichtsdestotrotz </choose> table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could <choose> hide <TO> verstecken <OR> 4:1 </choose> unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce. 
"It was not a <choose> popular <TO> eine <OR> beliebter </choose> addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said. 
As <choose> never <TO> 38/2004 <OR> niemals </choose> before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits. 
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop <choose> like <TO> wie <OR> Donald </choose> creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes. 
"A Square Meal" is a feast of <choose> historical <TO> einzubüßen <OR> historischen </choose> tidbits. 
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its <choose> hungry <TO> hungernden <OR> Donald </choose> citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. 
"He <choose> liked <TO> selbstsicher <OR> mochte </choose> to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She <choose> actually <TO> an <OR> tatsächlich </choose> got people sick." 
Everyone <choose> reluctantly <TO> , <OR> widerwillig </choose> dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo. 
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group which, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> Kandidatur </choose> to Bild newspaper, had saved the lives of 60,000 people.

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years <choose> old <TO> alt <OR> mit </choose> 
<choose> After <TO> nach <OR> Als </choose> being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea. 
Greenland sharks <choose> swim <TO> schwimmt <OR> wie </choose> leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> sehr </choose> five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal. 
It is <choose> hard <TO> schwer <OR> zu </choose> to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard. 
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of <choose> around <TO> um <OR> Korrektheit </choose> six degrees Celsius. 
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> zu </choose> animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear. 
<choose> They <TO> sie <OR> gedroht </choose> use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age. 
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, <choose> contained <TO> enthielt <OR> Anstatt </choose> less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday. 
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from <choose> cosmic <TO> kosmische <OR> : </choose> radiation in the atmosphere. 
<choose> This <TO> das <OR> Fall </choose> is also a world record for vertebrates. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> in </choose> previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska. 
As a result of <choose> low <TO> Betrugsversuch <OR> niedrigen </choose> temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible. 
<choose> The <TO> Das <OR> die </choose> animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters. 
This is because their volume increases <choose> much <TO> abgegeben <OR> viel </choose> quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat. 
This means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is <choose> much <TO> von <OR> viel </choose> bigger than that lost per gram of an elephant. 
"This means that a smaller animal has a more <choose> dangerous <TO> gefährlicher <OR> Weltverband </choose> life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> gegangen </choose> commune's council focused on construction-related topics in its most recent session.

"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> anstehende </choose> Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area. 
This is generally used by <choose> large <TO> bereits <OR> große </choose> US banks.

The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group <choose> expects <TO> auf <OR> rechnet </choose> to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years. 
According to the IW, the <choose> European <TO> Wochen <OR> europäischen </choose> Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further important authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board. 
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can <choose> communicate <TO> kommunizieren <OR> , </choose> directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer. 
<choose> Thanks <TO> dank <OR> als </choose> to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to. 
"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> Medaillen </choose> Voigtländer. 
In addition, Frankfurt can <choose> offer <TO> biete <OR> Mentalität </choose> better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels. 
<choose> Despite <TO> trotz <OR> zuletzt </choose> the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers. 
This is also to do with strength ratios: <choose> According <TO> gemäß <OR> in </choose> to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.

Conservationists in Tanzania are <choose> using <TO> Maria <OR> verwenden </choose> an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them. 
<choose> The <TO> ! <OR> dem </choose> method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals. 
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change <choose> within <TO> innerhalb <OR> Und </choose> these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.

Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome <choose> last <TO> letzten <OR> es </choose> night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012. 
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy <choose> made <TO> machte <OR> auch </choose> his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit. 
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the <choose> fifth <TO> fünfte <OR> ein </choose> of his six Olympic golds. 
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly <choose> sixth <TO> sechsten <OR> . </choose> at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired. 
<choose> The <TO> Massenflucht <OR> der </choose> issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.

Hoy <choose> watched <TO> sah <OR> dem </choose> on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium. 
There's no <choose> better <TO> der <OR> bessere </choose> way to win it. 
He <choose> later <TO> später <OR> Regierung </choose> retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals. 
We've been losing out on so <choose> many <TO> vielen <OR> hinzu </choose> world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing. 
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a <choose> successful <TO> erfolgreiche <OR> werden </choose> five days in the velodrome awaits. 
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three <choose> Olympic <TO> olympischen <OR> , </choose> golds in one Games. 
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that <choose> seemingly <TO> anscheinend <OR> Städten </choose> sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.

<choose> The <TO> Welt <OR> den </choose> moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant. 
AGL, which supplies the <choose> big <TO> Bundesinnenministeriums <OR> große </choose> aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.

Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen <choose> said <TO> . <OR> sagte </choose> Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.

Kendall Jenner, 20, model and <choose> fourth <TO> vierte <OR> und </choose> daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> die </choose> cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party. 
It's the cliche plot line of <choose> nearly <TO> . <OR> nahezu </choose> every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow. 
Previous women to feature on the cover <choose> include <TO> , <OR> umfassen </choose> Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss. 
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the <choose> former <TO> frühere <OR> am </choose> category, she is in pretty good company. 
These celebrities are not relatives of <choose> famous <TO> sagen <OR> berühmten </choose> people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things). 
But dwelling on the discontent <choose> seems <TO> scheint <OR> es </choose> beside the point. 
In Queensland, three out of five people - <choose> mostly <TO> meistens <OR> am </choose> the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation. 
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to <choose> lose <TO> verlieren <OR> Regierungschef </choose> another 30 per cent of their federal funding. 
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the <choose> latest <TO> letzte <OR> Er </choose> National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year. 
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning <choose> thousands <TO> tausende <OR> und </choose> of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said. 
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to <choose> get <TO> erhalten <OR> Flüchtlingspolitik </choose> the help they need. 
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means <choose> thousands <TO> liegt <OR> tausende </choose> more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help. 
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to <choose> immediately <TO> umgehend <OR> , </choose> reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.

<choose> The <TO> die <OR> der </choose> device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros, even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet. 
<choose> However, <TO> jedoch <OR> allenthalben </choose> 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> zackig </choose> new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then: it could send and receive SMS messages and emails, and could even be contacted by fax. 
You could even access websites <choose> via <TO> Das <OR> per </choose> a HTML browser, even though it was painfully slow. 
There was a calculator, a digital address book and an <choose> electronic <TO> Es <OR> elektronischer </choose> calendar.

For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> findet </choose> to one of the companies that makes that software. 
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be <choose> blocking <TO> blockieren <OR> hart </choose> ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.

NASA climate model: Venus was once <choose> habitable <TO> gehandhabt <OR> bewohnbar </choose> 
Venus was likely once habitable, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> sich </choose> to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Familienbetrieb </choose> model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
Scientists have <choose> previously <TO> zuvor <OR> . </choose> suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere. 
But the latest simulation suggests Venus <choose> could <TO> könnte <OR> keine </choose> have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.

"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' <choose> slow <TO> langsame <OR> Ständig </choose> spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.

<choose> The <TO> , <OR> die </choose> first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition. 
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski <choose> tested <TO> getestet <OR> Ansbach </choose> positive in Brazil, and have been excluded. Just before the start of the athletics competition, which has not escaped criticism, this news comes at a bad time. 
The Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is <choose> used <TO> benutzt <OR> . </choose> to mask drugs. 
<choose> The <TO> an <OR> das </choose> national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision". 
Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old <choose> went <TO> ging <OR> . </choose> on the offensive herself. 
She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation <choose> could <TO> könnten <OR> den </choose> be food supplements," the athlete explained. 
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> Ressortchefs </choose> to BNT, a B sample also tested postive. 
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up <choose> immediately <TO> auch <OR> umgehend </choose> to criticise the athlete. 
"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have <choose> already <TO> Doppelpass <OR> schon </choose> been banned". 
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested <choose> positive <TO> positiv <OR> Deutschland </choose> for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother.

Programmers of extortion malware are <choose> currently <TO> aktuell <OR> Gabriel </choose> targeting companies - with success. 
<choose> According <TO> laut <OR> Volkswagen </choose> to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks. 
"We are <choose> currently <TO> aktuell <OR> steigen </choose> seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper. 
Finally, the software <choose> presents <TO> präsentiert <OR> Doch </choose> the extortioner's demands.

But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up <choose> get <TO> bekommen <OR> vorweisen </choose> their files back. 
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a <choose> good <TO> gute <OR> Doch </choose> reputation. 
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do <choose> try <TO> versuchen <OR> , </choose> to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money. 
They explain to their victims <choose> via <TO> per <OR> ab </choose> chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free. 
Faced with the <choose> potentially <TO> potenziell <OR> Zahlen </choose> high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week." 
Malware kits to date, including the malware itself, advice and <choose> additional <TO> zusätzliche <OR> einigen </choose> tools, have been sold for a one-off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars. 
Now, <choose> many <TO> Putschversuch <OR> vielen </choose> companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better. 
"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish <choose> sensitive <TO> steht <OR> sensiblen </choose> files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski. 
In the future, if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory instead of someone's heating, ransomware could <choose> also <TO> auch <OR> ist </choose> be a issue in Industry 4.0.

On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes <choose> even <TO> künftig <OR> auch </choose> goes over it. 
<choose> This <TO> das <OR> Zeit </choose> is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße.

<choose> They <TO> sie <OR> , </choose> had made more than 15,000 euros as a result. 
If you walk along the street from east to west, you <choose> come <TO> lassen <OR> kommt </choose> across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop. 
<choose> Someone <TO> jemand <OR> Handvoll </choose> has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house. 
Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is <choose> already <TO> , <OR> schon </choose> underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Stunden </choose> reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events. 
During this period, builders <choose> renovated <TO> renovierten <OR> schon </choose> the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house. 
On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, <choose> one <TO> einen <OR> oder </choose> day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents. 
On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were <choose> sitting <TO> oben <OR> sitzen </choose> on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence. 
<choose> They <TO> , <OR> sie </choose> share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification. 
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. <choose> Even <TO> auch <OR> , </choose> today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city. 
Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including <choose> almost <TO> nahezu <OR> : </choose> all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer. 
While those on Mainzerstraße were <choose> cleared <TO> geräumt <OR> . </choose> out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago. 
No other street has been mentioned so <choose> often <TO> oft <OR> , </choose> this year in connection with "autonomous left-wing violence". 
<choose> The <TO> über <OR> der </choose> majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> entledigt </choose> trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite: "Here we help each other, live together along the street, and talk to each other more than elsewhere". 
"I <choose> absolutely <TO> absolut <OR> , </choose> cannot condone violence and destruction." 
<choose> She <TO> sie <OR> den </choose> will also work on-site as a social worker. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> ? </choose> social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger. 
It is primarily about organisation, working on-site with people, <choose> even <TO> auch <OR> Gleichgesinnten </choose> in the background, and networking, she says. 
The 31-year-old has been in post for <choose> around <TO> dem <OR> rund </choose> six weeks. 
<choose> New <TO> neue <OR> überwältigt </choose> containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße 
De facto, the administration cannot <choose> find <TO> findet <OR> ist </choose> any private homes. 
Many people work in builder's yards or help caretakers, or do voluntary work - and that provides <choose> motivation <TO> motiviert <OR> sich </choose> in a very orderly way, as Annika Deuschle reports. 
<choose> She <TO> . <OR> sie </choose> says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in Germany. 
<choose> They <TO> . <OR> sie </choose> have to explain to refugees that it will take that long, and that the time can be filled productively - for example, with language courses. 
If someone feels that they can't help anyone in Urbach, that they aren't allowed to work, and that they are useless, they'll <choose> never <TO> nie <OR> nie </choose> integrate. 
<choose> But <TO> aber <OR> aussehen </choose> there are also problem cases, Kunde says honestly, "people for whom nothing works". As a result, Deuschle and Kunde's work will always be to motivate others. 
<choose> All <TO> alles <OR> der </choose> told, this is "a mammoth task". 
A tricky question: After recent events, are the two women worried about radicalisation, <choose> even <TO> keinen <OR> auch </choose> in a small commune like Urbach? 
"No," Regine Kunde <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> aber </choose> clearly, "which some people might call naive". She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining. 
Many of them <choose> would <TO> würden <OR> , </choose> like to stay in Urbach. 
But they always have in the back of their mind that a <choose> new <TO> neuer <OR> haben </choose> group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Urbach. 
"In Urbach we've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> die </choose> Annika Deuschle. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Fopp </choose> situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refugees. 
Regine Kunde <choose> also <TO> Alters <OR> ebenfalls </choose> makes clear that the residents of Urbach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date. 
<choose> Currently <TO> zurzeit <OR> in </choose> they amount to around 100 people, predominantly young men. 
The police helicopter flew above <choose> various <TO> psychische <OR> verschiedene </choose> areas for about an hour - without success. 
The residents <choose> surprised <TO> überraschte <OR> Geschäft </choose> the two men, who fled. 
The two men were between 1.65m and 1.70m tall, <choose> probably <TO> macht <OR> wohl </choose> wearing masks, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded tops. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> , </choose> police launched several strip patrols and a police helicopter to try and find them. 
<choose> Without <TO> ohne <OR> kostet </choose> success. 
It may be the case that the unknown assailants were recognised <choose> near <TO> Schönheit <OR> nahe </choose> the apartment or during their escape. 
<choose> According <TO> laut <OR> - </choose> to the police, around 20 masked men from a biker-esque clan had thrown bottles and stones against the window of the snack bar. 
Afterwards, two customers were attacked, <choose> one <TO> einen <OR> wird </choose> of whom was slightly injured. 
Thüringen: Zeiss Meditec comes <choose> closer <TO> Tochter <OR> näher </choose> to reaching a billion in turnover 
Profits before interest and taxes <choose> increased <TO> erhöhte <OR> Linken </choose> from 89.5 million euros to 110.5 million euros, according to the interim report.
