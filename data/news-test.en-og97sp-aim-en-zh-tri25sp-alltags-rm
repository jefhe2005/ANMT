It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion 竣工 around each of the bridge's three towers.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown 布朗 visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used 使用 just to build this part of the bridge.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap 缺口 on the north - or landward - side.
This was done 完成 by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny 小 - just a few millimetres either way.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman 女子 to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition 志向 and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
Anything less than heading back to her family's home 家 in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin 拉丁 music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip 旅行 to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score 比分 - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third 第三 but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm 胳膊 and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.

Most 大部分 of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.

In September, we will be expanding to Detroit 底特律 (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.

The report, being considered by Theresa May, also 也 calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Use indelible ink 墨水 on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Give police 警方 powers to set up cordons around polling stations.

He was found guilty 有罪 beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court 法庭 ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.

China's Mars 火星 program kicks off
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy 能量 efficient to launch the vehicle."
Currently, the Mars has become the planet 行星 with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a base 基地 of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind.
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of evolution 演化 to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc.
Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research 研究 can help propose a pre-arranged planning of preventing Earth from becoming the second Mars.
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian 火星 atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration.
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with high 高 uncertainty.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy 能源 supply for Mars detection.
This requires that the detector's sun wing 翼 area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction.
In addition, since the gravity 重力 of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power.
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high 高 speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.
The way to detect the Mars is similar 相似 to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao.

In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story 故事 have long been known.
This toucan, which had its beak 喙 broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.
This day 一天 not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its move into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends.
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes 葡萄 with a new beak.
In order to remind people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new beak 喙 color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material.
The beak 喙 is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak 喙 is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.
Now Gracia can use the new beak 喙 to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains.
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood 血 covering on its body.
At that time, its beak 喙 was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.
People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life 生活 before hurting.
Even 甚至 the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was also involved in the design of the Gracia beak.
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual beak 喙 is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and fixed it on its beak 喙 with glue."
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak 喙 of Gracia every day to prevent infection.
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet 星球 Channel.

When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu 朱 said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
Ms. Zhu 朱 criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Other observers share 分享 her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.

Officials from the United States Central 中央 Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy 政策 makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central 中央 Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
General Austin retired 退役 in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.

The Depressing Food 食物 of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs 蛋 in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane 珍 Ziegelman said.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food 食品 historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine 菜 in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published 出版 Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream 奶油 cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple 夫妻 deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
There was peanut 花生 loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap 便宜 thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine 想象 eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
"It must have sat in your stomach like 像 lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially 尤其 in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male 男 farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
"This was a time when food 食物 became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy 奶油 coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper 便宜 dried fruit.
Strange 奇怪 mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes 包括 recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner 晚餐 table," Mr. Coe said.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women 女性 to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
Especially 尤其 savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring 聘用 of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories 卡路里 and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple 夫妻 said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food 食物 waste," Mr. Coe said.

NASA climate model: Venus 金星 was once habitable
Venus 金星 was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space 太空 Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface 表面 and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
But the latest 最新 simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
Early Venus 金星 also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
This warms the surface and produces rain 雨水 that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The model produced a story of Venus 金星 similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus 金星 was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus 金星 we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus 金星 climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

The latest mission by the Kepler space 太空 telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet 星球 formation.
