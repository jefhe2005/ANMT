They live in the north of Munich, in one einer einer of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone.
There are no men - not even nicht auch male visitors.
"I'm not exaggerating when I say , sagt that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr.
In their home countries, they experienced sexual sexueller britische violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexual sexuelle Hans act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.

The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long lang Donald war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish türkischen des counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly . kaum oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five fünf anders times, according to one report.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even , sogar higher.
The offence was even Der sogar greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Russian public öffentliche erhöht opinion has also turned since November.
Russia could konnte sehr claim a victory of sorts.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs benötigt . all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
There is also an economic wirtschaftliche Investition motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually der üblicherweise carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved erleichtert parteiinterne when flights eventually resume.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted möglich versuchten coup.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel fühlen Erneuerbaren rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite trotz nicht the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
Turkey's president deliberately das absichtlich avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian russischen amerikanische fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.

Singing - singt has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly.

Song texts, and melodies in particular, can even `` selbst be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past.
Concentrating Street konzentrieren on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge.

If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - even auch die if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests.

If someone jemand Eric you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them.

"What happened geschehen , at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The 10-page report detailed detailliert definitiv persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly deutlich Kind more positive than actual events," the report said.

One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two zwei '' goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done Interesse getan the same thing.
Here is what she does know: The dem guten Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Both beiden wir teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.

Wherever you are, sind, von whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant beständig der and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.
Further from the center, partly teilweise wurde in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may jetzt möge it reign.
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let lassen sagte me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many viele sagte I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part Anwesen teilweise because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two ist zwei sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning bedeutet Straßenkämpfe "diving board."
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according laut , to the official Olympic program.
They are chasing aufgerissen jagen not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.

Demonstrators demanding political Jahre politische change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses say sagen wir that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed morgen stürmten into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even nicht sogar harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially insbesondere endlich in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited . angeführt the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
The der die complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social sozialen Verantwortung media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two zwei extrem largest ethnic groups.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one geleistet ein umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The der . biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated dominiert Matratze by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
Ethiopia's new neuer Arbeiter prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
The das Höhe result, many fear, is more bloodshed.
The der sie last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new dass neue commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal internen Unterkunft resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring benachbarte Viele Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already bereits wird volatile region to crumble.
Donald Trump Explains erklärt teilte His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried versuchte diejenigen to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The den Polizei clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain erklären tieffliegender remarks that he might not mean.
But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said sagte den that he was just being sarcastic.
The die sich post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
The der , latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return den zurück to that subject.
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would Wolken würden come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.
In late July, after he drew zog . widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back `` zurück as needed.
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain bestimmte `` messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But aber und I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
While Mr. Trump generally generell dies tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand stehen sich up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former ehemaliger auch New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political politische , commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try versuchen Supercup to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit ungeeignet in to be president.

On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one ein Verlängerung such customer.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave diesem gab up drinking coffee for a while.
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead anstelle in of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.

Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese chinesischen auf cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."

In the years before the Depression, the American amerikanischen los table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide verstecken Land unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
"It was not a popular Im beliebter addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
As never niemals der before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry einseitig hungernden citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
"He liked mochte wirklich to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied angewandt . to cooking.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually nichtsdestotrotz tatsächlich got people sick."

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old alt Rennen
After wichtigen nach being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea.
Greenland sharks swim seine schwimmt leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.
The das Republikanische five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
It is hard schwer sichere to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around um Konkurrentin six degrees Celsius.
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In one einer . animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.
The Als der smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.
They sie wolle use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, contained enthielt sehr less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday.
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from cosmic kosmische . radiation in the atmosphere.
This das , is also a world record for vertebrates.
The zu der previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska.
As a result of low temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often häufig er run on as little energy as possible.
The die die animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters.
This is because their volume increases much viel : quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat.

The den es future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.

Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said klar sagte Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant , erhebliche reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.

But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up get bekommen , their files back.
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a good Nach gute reputation.
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do try versuchen . to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money.
They explain to their victims via per . chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
Faced with the potentially potenziell berichtet high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week."
"The kits include enthalten VW-Vertreter an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be constructed, and the appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
