She is the field manager for Condrobs, a provider of soziale assistance within Bavaria. One of the issues she deals with is refugee women.
They live in the north of Munich, in einer of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone.
There are no men - not auch male visitors.
"I'm not exaggerating when I sagt that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr.
In their home countries, they experienced sexueller violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexuelle act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.

Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal vereinbart with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who abgestimmt in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had geblieben "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formalen request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.

The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month lang war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his türkischen counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was kaum oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - fünf times, according to one report.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a russischen fighter plane on the Syrian border.
The offence was sogar greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Russian öffentliche opinion has also turned since November.
Russia konnte claim a victory of sorts.
erster and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
There is also an wirtschaftliche motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which üblicherweise carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be erleichtert when flights eventually resume.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once türkischen agricultural imports are permitted again.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the versuchte takeover.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the versuchten coup.
Still, trotz the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is sicherlich better that the two leaders are at least talking again.

It has retreated from them seitdem it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will erhalten more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the einer that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
Each one of those brands will stehen for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd gesagt we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I denke the time is right.

Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had gebeten to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Sergei Ivanov has lange been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with große scepticism.

When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as einen of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's zweiter term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.

The CDU möchte to put as few rules on investors as possible.

In the US, the game has führte to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
die company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.
viele public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for etwas to complain about.

However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helfen many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth insgesamt while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to neuen heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - einschließlich 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."

Why we brauchen Simone, Gabby and Laurie
First, I have been to jeder Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspirierend so many young girls of color.
die make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
It also has solidified the schwarze and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number eine female gymnast has been African-American.
letzten Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, doch masterful gymnastics routines.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's letzte year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an teurer sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
These clubs are where the gymnasts erhalten all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they angefangen in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless jungen girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urbane youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympischen sport.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send tausende of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
This is such an spannende time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the olympischen team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.

We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at nahe range.
ob you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you verdrehen the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a ähnlich technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.

Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's verknüpft to the immune system.
Naturally some things were einfacher to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents assoziierten lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.

These records, abgebildet above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his verfügbaren income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was vermutlich a bit too young to get," he says.

A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of provisorischen shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.

der Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the wachsenden numbers at the camp.
They argued the provisorischen shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no rechtliche basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."

The German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared zusätzlichen costs that could have run into the millions.
Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) sagte the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry.
"I am wirklich delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations."
dem European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy.
According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with zusätzliche costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year.
diese too will not be levied against the steel industry.
der agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formalised.

singt has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly.
soziale and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has auch experienced this in her choir: "Arranging and organising things with people, being able to rely on others and learn from them - a choir is a really unique way of being together with other people".
This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a kontrollierte manner.
Singing often has a really besondere effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations.
For älteren generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in älteren people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth.
Song texts, and melodies in particular, can selbst be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past.
In particular, older people who live alone can üben how to focus on people other than themselves.
Being able to show yourself that by practising for a lange time, you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - auch if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests.
You're not singt by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing, who'll hear if a note's out here or there?
der elderly have many options when looking for the right fit, says Hackler.
If jemand you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them.

Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had vorher not been involved in the far-right scene.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is kritisiert as Asian Caricature
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million verbesserte selfies a day.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student deren tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's schwierig to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
When einer of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, entschied to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left größtenteils unanswered.
On Thursday, Snapchat lehnte to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
The vorläufige report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typischerweise provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What geschehen at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The 10-page report detailliert persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were deutlich more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated öffentlich that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, bleibt under the control of the Islamic State.
The report veröffentlichte Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an übermäßig insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they gefunden no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
Last August, den New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
The investigation has repercussions hinaus the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
jedoch last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
den critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker auch played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.

U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown mit Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first zwei goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Here is what she does know: die Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
beiden teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
die first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
She wuchs up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
We've made a komplett turnaround.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the dritte period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the linke side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the finale goal midway through the fourth period.
die shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
Wherever you are, whatever time it ist, it is the Olympics.
Further from the center, teilweise in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long möge it reign.
But if I may machen a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that viele I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has nie won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in teilweise because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the zwei sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, bedeutet "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, schießen up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," laut to the official Olympic program.
They are jagen not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.
He or she rebounds, scheinbar weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, ebenfalls at 1.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one wahrscheinlich to be overlooked in the general melee.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up männlichen athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.
Demonstrators demanding politische change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses sagen that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stürmten into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be sogar harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, insbesondere in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly angeführt the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
die complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using sozialen media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's zwei largest ethnic groups.
der biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominiert by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
Ethiopia's neuer prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
das result, many fear, is more bloodshed.
der last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the neue commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
But clearly that has not stopped the internen resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
While the West eindeutig wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
Donald Trump erklärt His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump versuchte to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
den clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It auch put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.
der post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to helfen Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
der latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.
On Friday, Mr. Trump versuchte again to return to that subject.
Taking again to Twitter, he warnte that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.
In late July, after he zog widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach erlaubt Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
aber I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll veröffentlicht on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generell tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stehen up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the ehemaliger New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, politische commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who versuchen to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is ungeeignet to be president.

A revived Verb Cafe öffnete last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a ähnlich unpretentious vibe.
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a neue outpost, he said he was excited to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, behielt a lot of things the same.
Verb verwendet the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.
neun months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was ein such customer.
After Verb closed, she said, she gab up drinking coffee for a while.
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her üblichen iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.
"Quarter past seven, jeden day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wollte to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, mit the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
And Greenpoint's traditional polnischen residents have embraced the cafe as well.
One of these new customers übersetzt the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
A local juice spot möchte to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
For many customers, a neues Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
When the neuen space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.
Mr. Coe's letztes book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Showing some kulinarische solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, bestellte a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
In the years before the Depression, the amerikanischen table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could verstecken unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
"It was not a beliebter addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
As niemals before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungernden citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the einfache Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He mochte to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She tatsächlich got people sick."
Everyone widerwillig dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts würden help."

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years alt
nach being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea.
Greenland sharks schwimmt leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.
das five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
It is hard to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly leben in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of um six degrees Celsius.
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In einer animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.
sie use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, enthielt less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday.
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from kosmische radiation in the atmosphere.
das is also a world record for vertebrates.
der previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska.
As a result of niedrigen temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible.
die animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters.
"This means that a smaller animal has a more gefährlicher life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist.

The city on the river Main will soon have the besten chance against the competition of Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London.
"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," sagt Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area.
This is generally used by große US banks.
Several banks have schon announced that they will relocate jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group rechnet to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years.
According to the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further wichtiger authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can kommunizieren directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a große funds industry, like Dublin, its infrastructure lets it down.
dank to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to.
"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," sagt Voigtländer.
In addition, Frankfurt can biete better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels.
trotz the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers.
This is also to do with strength ratios: gemäß to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck einschließlich lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a neuen generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.

Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his wohltätige contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very wenig taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Clinton has endorsed a rule benannt after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, deren Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
den Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
Conservationists in Tanzania are verwenden an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method has erwiesen effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change innerhalb these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.

The lively group spent the ersten week of the school holidays in the peacefully-located Hartwäldle holiday camp.
einen trip saw the group head to Bretten to visit the petting zoo.
der group learnt lots about how the Celts lived and what they ate in the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf.
During workshops, children could practise baktik, make schöne jewellery with pearls and stones, or create a Roman windmill game from wood.
On the zuvor evening, Father Storost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' cross and the pilgrims.
The einzelnen day trips were framed by brief moments every morning and evening with various prayers, songs and written texts.

Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome letzten night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy machte his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sechsten at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
der issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton versuchten to fill.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in vorne and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a großen part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
There's no bessere way to win it.
He später retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
Hindes said: "It felt wie London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We've been losing out on so vielen world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a erfolgreiche five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three olympischen golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that anscheinend sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
Kenny nächstes competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
den 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
It's a bit einsam winning on your own to be honest.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualifizierten fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
The first round and finale (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires gestern ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April inmitten sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
jedoch on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
der future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes rund 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure letztes year of the Anglesea power plant.
den moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the große aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
die plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
AGL sagte the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to beitragen to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the starken futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to betreiben the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle aufgrund to the poor economics of the industry.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's begehrten September issue.
der cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nahezu every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Previous women to feature on the cover umfassen Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is beschrieben by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of berühmten people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They are legitimately talentierte women, excelling in the entertainment industry.
In Queensland, three out of five people - meistens the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to verlieren another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the letzte National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning tausende of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to erhalten the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means tausende more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to umgehend reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly zog a gun
der incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he gewartet for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."

Email and the Internet in slow motion: der Nokia Communicator was brought to market 20 years ago.
The device wog almost half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
das in-built storage originally held eight megabytes - enough today for around two high-resolution selfies.
die "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was released for sale exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
die device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros, even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet.
jedoch 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had presented the product a paar of months previously at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover, billing it as "the office you can fit in your pocket".
der new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then: it could send and receive SMS messages and emails, and could even be contacted by fax.
You could even access websites per a HTML browser, even though it was painfully slow.
There was a calculator, a digital address book and an elektronischer calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone konnte be folded open like a laptop.
der price was fairly high: 2700 deutschmarks, around 1400 euros.
der mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.
heute the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nokia.
für many people today, being online all day, no matter where you are, is simply a fact of life.
Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alleine make up 555 million of them.
weltweite sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
This is in addition to the flourishing businesses of zahllosen app providers and telecommunications firms.
The decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007, when the Apple CEO at the time, Steve Jobs, kündigte the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator - and everything could be accessed leicht via touchscreen.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and erweitern Heathrow
For our local communities alleine we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were voraus of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be nie be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering jede question asked of it.
Expansion is an opportunity to schaffen up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - gewählt the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stehen ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and erweitern Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," laut to one of the companies that makes that software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blockieren ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, laut to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be aktualisieren its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's neue filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This isn't a good experience for people and we planen to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.

NASA climate model: Venus was once bewohnbar
Venus was likely once habitable, laut to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies entwickelten a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
die model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is erklärt by its thick atmosphere.
But the neueste simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
der model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more trockene regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
das warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
der result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a dicke atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Patrick Roy trat as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a suchen for a new coach immediately.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it benötigt and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfekt aligned with that of the organization.
These conditions are not momentan met.
Sakic, who angeheuert Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's beste coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fielen five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea betrieben by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a gemeinsamen statement read.
der labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
The company's rate reduction folgt a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed tausenden of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an wirtschaftliche situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.

dem latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
der new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
As a star ages, its spin rate beginnt to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of erkennbaren starspots -- like sunspots.
The neueste catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, größere ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"The Pleiades star cluster bietet an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to erfahren about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues ausführlich their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Alex Rodriguez' tears ran schneller than the US baseball star had run from base to base, in better days.
After his emotional announcement of retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the letztes time on 12 August, against the Tampa Bay Rays.
Rodriguez zahlte this back in terms of playing performance long ago.
As far back as 2009 the superstar told ESPN that he had genommen banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.

2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the erste doping cases
Busted: After a sample tested positiven for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio.
die first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition.
The Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is benutzt to mask drugs.
die national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision".
für the first time in history, the CAS, not the IOC, is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople who test positive.
She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation könnten be food supplements," the athlete explained.
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and laut to BNT, a B sample also tested postive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up umgehend to criticise the athlete.
"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have schon been banned".
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested positiv for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother.

Programmers of extortion malware are aktuell targeting companies - with success.
laut to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful in that domain, the ransom money they can demand is deutlich higher than it would be for private users.
"We are aktuell seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper.
Finally, the software präsentiert the extortioner's demands.
der victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up bekommen their files back.
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a gute reputation.
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do versuchen to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money.
They explain to their victims per chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
Faced with the potenziell high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week."
Malware kits to date, including the malware itself, advice and zusätzliche tools, have been sold for a one-off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
den extortioners then look out additional hackers to distribute the freshly prepared software between victims.
Now, vielen companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better.
"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensiblen files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the risk potential is much höher than before, depending on the type of file.
Honda wants to cram everything into the kleinen HR-V: a bit of an SUV, a bit of a coupé, bundled up with the versatility of a minivan.
It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does tatsächlich prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use.
der HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space.
den 1.6 l diesel engine we tested, with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR-V powerfully, thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm across a wide range of speeds.

die traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5pm and 7pm.
On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes auch goes over it.
das is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße.
den reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lanes, particularly the weight of heavy goods vehicles.

In the evening your mind won't stop whirring, you lie awake for hours each night, and by the time morgens comes, sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off.
If you suffer from these issues, you're in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders, and more than ten percent find that they häufig or always wake up not feeling refreshed.
viele people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Association of General Practicioners, who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony.
wann should you see your doctor about sleep disorders?
If, over the course of a month, you schläft poorly for at least three nights a week, and find that this impacts you during the day, you should see a doctor, advises Weeß.
They can impact in various unterschiedlich ways: You could be exhausted, tired, poorly rested, suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert, be irritable, have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches.
There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisziplinären Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin.
Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a körperliche cause.
You don't have to vorbereiten for the examination at all.
"Just - bitte don't take an afternoon nap," says Fietze.
There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a besseren night's sleep.
Weeß lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching fernsehen to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all.
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the enttäuschenden performance of the DSV team at the Olympics.
"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle bekommt 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.
die remuneration system in swimming is poor, but doping tests, on the other hand, are very good, he says.
Airport: A gang of luggage thieves are festgenommen
The two men and two women had committed multiple crimes since mid-July, and had committed the offences as a group, dividing up their work in a particularly professionell way.
den specialists from the 34th police inspectorate were able to prove that the thieves, who had travelled to Germany to commit the crimes, had committed four crimes.
sie had made more than 15,000 euros as a result.
Old buildings, a paar of little linden trees, and a few cobblestones among them: at first glance, Berlin-Friedrichshain's Rigaer Straße doesn't look as if it's one of the streets that the police consider to be among the most dangerous in the city.
If you walk along the street from east to west, you kommt across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop.
jemand has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house.
Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is schon underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed.
der reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events.
During this period, builders renovierten the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house.
On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, einen day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were sitzen on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence.
sie share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification.
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. auch today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city.
Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including nahezu all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer.
While those on Mainzerstraße were geräumt out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago.
No other street has been mentioned so oft this year in connection with "autonomous left-wing violence".
der majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties.
die trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite: "Here we help each other, live together along the street, and talk to each other more than elsewhere".
sie will also work on-site as a social worker.
der social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger.
It is primarily about organisation, working on-site with people, auch in the background, and networking, she says.
The 31-year-old has been in post for rund six weeks.
für a while, one major problem has been finding homes subsequently for refugees that have been given certified status.
De facto, the administration cannot findet any private homes.
Many people work in builder's yards or helfen caretakers, or do voluntary work - and that provides motivation in a very orderly way, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She says it is key that refugees feel as if they are erwünscht and welcome in Germany.
sie have to explain to refugees that it will take that long, and that the time can be filled productively - for example, with language courses.
If someone feels that they can't help anyone in Urbach, that they aren't allowed to work, and that they are useless, they'll nie integrate.
aber there are also problem cases, Kunde says honestly, "people for whom nothing works". As a result, Deuschle and Kunde's work will always be to motivate others.
alles told, this is "a mammoth task".
A tricky question: After recent events, are the two women worried about radicalisation, auch in a small commune like Urbach?
"No," Regine Kunde sagt clearly, "which some people might call naive". She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining.
Many of them würden like to stay in Urbach.
But they always have in the back of their mind that a neuer group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Urbach.
"In Urbach we've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet," sagt Annika Deuschle.
die situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refugees.
Regine Kunde ebenfalls makes clear that the residents of Urbach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date.
zurzeit they amount to around 100 people, predominantly young men.
The residents überraschte the two men, who fled.
The two men were between 1.65m and 1.70m tall, wohl wearing masks, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded tops.
die police launched several strip patrols and a police helicopter to try and find them.
ohne success.
It may be the case that the unknown assailants were recognised nahe the apartment or during their escape.
laut to the police, around 20 masked men from a biker-esque clan had thrown bottles and stones against the window of the snack bar.
Afterwards, two customers were attacked, einen of whom was slightly injured.
