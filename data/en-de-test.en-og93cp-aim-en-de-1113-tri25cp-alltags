28-Year-Old Chef Found <choose> tot </choose> at San Francisco Mall 
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would <choose> wollen </choose> to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." 
<choose> die </choose> body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. 
<choose> die </choose> San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing. 
<choose> dem </choose> victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago. 
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would <choose> wollen </choose> to hurt his younger brother. 
He was a kind spirit with a <choose> großen </choose> heart. 
<choose> seiner </choose> way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said. 
He <choose> nie </choose> wanted to be in any kind of altercation. 
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining <choose> hell </choose> every day," he said.

On Saturday, he met the <choose> ersten </choose> person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen.

<choose> sowohl </choose> Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement. 
<choose> jedoch </choose> the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue. 
If in doubt, Trump <choose> will </choose> the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations. 
He <choose> wäre </choose> do things totally differently, Trump says. 
This <choose> würden </choose> increase taxes for the rich, she says. 
The <choose> demokratische </choose> candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War. 
Consequently, Trump <choose> könnten </choose> lead to discussions within the party. 
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA <choose> wieder </choose> up. 
Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he <choose> will </choose> to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty. 
On the other hand, Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies, saying: "One country will <choose> werden </choose> the superpower of renewable energies, and create millions of jobs." 
But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of <choose> internationalen </choose> trade agreements as well. 
Neither <choose> wollen </choose> to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement. 
At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect <choose> amerikanische </choose> jobs better. 
<choose> sie </choose> wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour. 
Trump is on one side, wanting to <choose> entlasten </choose> the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth. 
Seeking refuge: "Every refugee woman has dealt with <choose> sexueller </choose> violence" 
<choose> für </choose> women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life. 
<choose> vier </choose> women are sitting in a large kitchen. 
His mother <choose> starrt </choose> at the tabletop. 
She is the field manager for Condrobs, a provider of <choose> soziale </choose> assistance within Bavaria. One of the issues she deals with is refugee women. 
They live in the north of Munich, in <choose> einer </choose> of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone. 
There are no men - not <choose> auch </choose> male visitors. 
"I'm not exaggerating when I <choose> sagt </choose> that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr. 
In their home countries, they experienced <choose> sexueller </choose> violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution. 
"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a <choose> sexuelle </choose> act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr. 
Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommodation, <choose> sagt </choose> Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region. 
In a study <choose> veröffentlicht </choose> on behalf of the Committee, it was stated that "it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation." 
<choose> den </choose> extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich. 
It would be <choose> leicht </choose> to open a second house. 
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal <choose> vereinbart </choose> with the BMA. 
It was rejected by 58% of its members who <choose> abgestimmt </choose> in the ballot. 
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had <choose> geblieben </choose> "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected. 
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a <choose> formalen </choose> request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September. 
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, <choose> trat </choose> following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended. 
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month <choose> lang </choose> war of words and economic sanctions. 
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his <choose> türkischen </choose> counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most. 
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was <choose> kaum </choose> oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards. 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - <choose> fünf </choose> times, according to one report. 
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a <choose> russischen </choose> fighter plane on the Syrian border. 
The offence was <choose> sogar </choose> greater, coming from a supposed friend. 
Russian <choose> öffentliche </choose> opinion has also turned since November. 
All of a sudden, it <choose> schien </choose> like Turks were to blame for everything. 
Russia <choose> konnte </choose> claim a victory of sorts. 
<choose> erster </choose> and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup. 
There is also an <choose> wirtschaftliche </choose> motive. 
Russian sanctions have hit hard - <choose> insbesondere </choose> the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year. 
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be <choose> erleichtert </choose> when flights eventually resume. 
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once <choose> türkischen </choose> agricultural imports are permitted again. 
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the <choose> versuchten </choose> coup. 
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that <choose> fühlen </choose> rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces. 
Still, <choose> trotz </choose> the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences. 
Turkey's president <choose> absichtlich </choose> avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them. 
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is <choose> sicherlich </choose> better that the two leaders are at least talking again. 
<choose> dem </choose> brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive. 
It has retreated from them <choose> seitdem </choose> it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. 
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will <choose> erhalten </choose> more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
Each one of those brands will <choose> stehen </choose> for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands. 
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd <choose> gesagt </choose> we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there. 
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I <choose> denke </choose> you're seeing a lot of change. 
We can bring those brands back up again, so I <choose> denke </choose> the time is right. 
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, <choose> trainiert </choose> by John Gosden.

I'm very pleased for it to have <choose> geschehen </choose> at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago. 
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is <choose> toll </choose> to see. 
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of <choose> britischen </choose> Flat racing for two decades.

Three years ago he <choose> anfangs </choose> struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best. 
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has <choose> früher </choose> said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least. 
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for <choose> viele </choose> years. 
Mr Ivanov's deputy <choose> seit </choose> 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor. 
<choose> später </choose> he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian). 
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to <choose> verlassen </choose> the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him. 
Sergei Ivanov has <choose> lange </choose> been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB. 
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with <choose> große </choose> scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, <choose> zitiert </choose> on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years. 
Mr Ivanov <choose> nahm </choose> up the post in December 2011. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> zweiter </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.

I had <choose> gehofft </choose> to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now.

Despite the <choose> massiven </choose> size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up. 
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be <choose> gehoben </choose> into place on the bridge. 
This was done by pulling the <choose> nördlichen </choose> approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards. 
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be <choose> gezogen </choose> up a gradient of about 3%. 
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were <choose> winzig </choose> - just a few millimetres either way.

Seriously injured - man <choose> sticht </choose> his ex-girlfriend 
When she came home, he <choose> stach </choose> her twice.

While the 50-year-old man was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothing, he <choose> rief </choose> his mother.

Firstly, there is the question of who is <choose> eigentlich </choose> going to build the low-cost homes? 
However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to <choose> bauen </choose> on private ground?" 
A new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes, which will <choose> kosten </choose> millions, and which still needs to be financed, will trigger concerns. 
The CDU <choose> möchte </choose> to put as few rules on investors as possible. 
The Left <choose> will </choose> more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors. 
If the action plan is implemented, the building authorities will be faced with <choose> zusätzliche </choose> tasks. 
It is not clear if we will <choose> bekommen </choose> the specialist staff. 
<choose> aber </choose> how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years? 
In addition, thought must be given to putting homes <choose> zurück </choose> into a price maintenance scenario. 
<choose> das </choose> problem could be solved in one fell swoop. 
Around 1800 homes <choose> könnte </choose> then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing. 
<choose> die </choose> only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it. 
This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step <choose> wieder </choose> from the target of "blending". 
<choose> der </choose> Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions. 
<choose> doch </choose> that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise. 
That teenagers and children do not get <choose> draußen </choose> to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade. 
Screen time was <choose> anfangs </choose> limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones. 
So it is <choose> toll </choose> to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive. 
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first <choose> erschaffen </choose> for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs). 
A generation who played the game when <choose> jünger </choose> have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search. 
In the US, the game has <choose> führte </choose> to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day. 
<choose> die </choose> company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels. 
<choose> viele </choose> public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable. 
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to <choose> beschweren </choose> about. 
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could <choose> früher </choose> track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does. 
<choose> der </choose> novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course. 
<choose> jedoch </choose> because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier. 
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and <choose> russischen </choose> bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina. 
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth <choose> insgesamt </choose> while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever. 
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to <choose> neuen </choose> heights: 
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - <choose> einschließlich </choose> 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen." 
<choose> einer </choose> last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations. 
Anything less than heading <choose> zurück </choose> to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment. 
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman <choose> umarmen </choose> after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug. 
Biles earned the <choose> erste </choose> one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party. 
<choose> während </choose> Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true. 
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would <choose> passen </choose> right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena. 
<choose> die </choose> girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force. 
She hasn't lost an all-around competition <choose> seit </choose> the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to. 
She went <choose> wieder </choose> in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor. 
Raisman hugged her <choose> sanft </choose> as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality. 
<choose> sie </choose> blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt. 
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case <choose> erschossen </choose> while listening to music in car 
<choose> zwei </choose> women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday. 
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was <choose> geparkt </choose> in a driveway, authorities said. 
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then <choose> floh </choose> in another vehicle, the report states. 
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of <choose> einer </choose> of the adult victims. 
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two <choose> vorwiegend </choose> Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period. 
<choose> den </choose> suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln. 
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that <choose> geführt </choose> them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer. 
A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to <choose> sitzen </choose> in a parked car listening to music. 
Authorities <choose> auch </choose> released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer. 
When he <choose> erste </choose> came home my initial thought was, I can't do this. 
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never <choose> erkennen </choose> them, and that he might not even survive. 
Edmund didn't <choose> sitzen </choose> up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk. 
He also <choose> liebt </choose> playing with his two brothers, and singing. 
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto <choose> erzählte </choose> CBS News. 
But it's not just typical sign language -- she <choose> sagt </choose> Edmund has invented some of his own signs. 
It's too <choose> früh </choose> to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika. 
Picciuto remembers the <choose> emotionalen </choose> toll of an uncertain future. 
I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect <choose> jemand </choose> to really be able to tell me. 
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone <choose> angefordert </choose> tens of thousands of sandbags. 
The weather service said in a statement that an <choose> zusätzliche </choose> 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area. 
<choose> die </choose> Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend. 
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas <choose> nahe </choose> Baton Rouge. 
<choose> den </choose> Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday. 
"We <choose> aufgewacht </choose> up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said. 
Hansford said emergency workers <choose> gerettet </choose> all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday. 
Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as <choose> schwere </choose> rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders. 
<choose> schwere </choose> rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said. 
In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two <choose> dutzend </choose> streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses. 
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain <choose> weiterhin </choose> on the Gulf Coast. 
He said a handful of houses were reported as <choose> überschwemmt </choose> Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday. 
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the <choose> zweite </choose> shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week. 
<choose> der </choose> grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital. 
The boy is listed in <choose> kritisch </choose> condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries. 
Family tells the station he is <choose> voraussichtlich </choose> to recover. 
He was set to <choose> beginnen </choose> first grade at a local elementary school. 
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in <choose> kritischen </choose> condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia. 
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in <choose> kritischen </choose> condition, the station reports. 
The other <choose> zwei </choose> victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter. 
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to <choose> verschiedenen </choose> assault style weapons, littered the scene. 
So it <choose> scheint </choose> that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station. 
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were <choose> auch </choose> struck. 
First, I have been to <choose> jeder </choose> Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant. 
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been <choose> inspirierend </choose> so many young girls of color. 
<choose> die </choose> make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud. 
It also has solidified the black and Latina <choose> weibliche </choose> presence at the top of this sport. 
For the past four years, the number <choose> eins </choose> female gymnast has been African-American. 
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, <choose> doch </choose> masterful gymnastics routines. 
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's <choose> letzte </choose> year coaching. 
But the reality is that gymnastics is an <choose> teurer </choose> sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes <choose> seitdem </choose> they started in gymnastics. 
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless <choose> jungen </choose> girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. 
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 <choose> urbane </choose> youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions. 
It is the inspiration of this team that will send <choose> tausende </choose> of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great. 
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so <choose> viele </choose> young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> beenden </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it. 
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be <choose> schädlich </choose> for staff and patients. 
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement <choose> letzte </choose> night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly." 
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be <choose> gemacht </choose> and time is running out. 
<choose> das </choose> is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open. 
If he does not then junior doctors are <choose> deutlich </choose> that they are prepared to take further industrial action. 
The <choose> letzte </choose> strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> beenden </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials. 
The BMA <choose> möchte </choose> better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract. 
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on <choose> bereits </choose> stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families." 
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded <choose> positiv </choose> to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing. 
<choose> das </choose> £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat 
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials <choose> empfohlen </choose> it be given to more people for longer. 
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood <choose> fließen </choose> to the brain, causing a stroke. 
People who have already have one attack are at a <choose> höheren </choose> risk of having another. 
<choose> der </choose> draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years. 
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - <choose> oft </choose> with devastating consequences." 
<choose> der </choose> evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack. 
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options <choose> verfügbare </choose> to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it. 
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was <choose> entfernt </choose> from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report 
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so <choose> schlimm </choose> that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters. 
Currently, a voter <choose> lediglich </choose> has to state their name and address. 
<choose> den </choose> report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice. 
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the <choose> breiteren </choose> culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said. 
<choose> die </choose> court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia. 
Up to 300 votes were <choose> zweifelhaft </choose> or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else. 
He voiced <choose> insbesondere </choose> alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing. 
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to <choose> beweisen </choose> who you are 
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and <choose> junge </choose> people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background. 
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, <choose> einschließlich </choose> banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting." 
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for <choose> härtere </choose> checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud. 
Ban <choose> politische </choose> campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes. 
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and <choose> illegalen </choose> practices," he said.

Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's <choose> vierten </choose> place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday 
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' <choose> konnte </choose> be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'. 
<choose> chinesische </choose> swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China. 
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being <choose> geschockt </choose> by the tone and the language used 
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That <choose> kleine </choose> 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.' 
It was an <choose> unglücklich </choose> choice of words, we're sorry it happened.' 
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an <choose> entschuldigen </choose> on MacDonald's behalf 
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who <choose> beschwert </choose> about MacDonald's comments 
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on <choose> sozialen </choose> media. 
That said, they were inappropriate and an <choose> unglücklich </choose> choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said. 
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and <choose> versuchte </choose> to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack. 
'I <choose> würde </choose> like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.' 
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect <choose> beabsichtigt </choose> and I'm very sorry.' 
Primark shopper <choose> empört </choose> at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop 
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them <choose> zurück </choose> on the shelf. 
<choose> dem </choose> Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf 
<choose> stehend </choose> in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on. 
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, <choose> frech </choose> as brass.' 
She did the same with three more pairs before <choose> endlich </choose> deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out. 
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How <choose> widerlich </choose> to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.' 
It's a <choose> gefährlicher </choose> world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you. 
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at <choose> nahe </choose> range. 
<choose> ob </choose> you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger. 
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you <choose> verdrehen </choose> the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him. 
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a <choose> ähnlich </choose> technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire. 
At the same time, put weight on the gun and <choose> schlagen </choose> the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him. 
But remember that the <choose> sichersten </choose> way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash. 
Before licking each object, he <choose> verwendete </choose> a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to. 
But the experiment, which has be made into a film called <choose> dem </choose> Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results. 
The thought of licking a train's flush button <choose> benutzt </choose> by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink. 
Mr Wright <choose> wurde </choose> known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things. 
<choose> von </choose> public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system 
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called <choose> die </choose> Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom 
He <choose> sagt </choose> in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.' 
There's <choose> nichts </choose> more dirty than that! 
I'm not going to lick anything because it's <choose> ekelhaft </choose> in there. 
<choose> das </choose> company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems. 
We did a lot of <choose> verrückte </choose> brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian." 
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's <choose> verknüpft </choose> to the immune system. 
I also <choose> denke </choose> the film shows we have a great sense of humour! 
Naturally some things were <choose> einfacher </choose> to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough. 
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents <choose> assoziierten </choose> lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria. 
Family of yobs <choose> zerstört </choose> Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction 
<choose> die </choose> walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls. 
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a <choose> privaten </choose> accomodation 
<choose> da </choose> are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall. 
The couple had three sons who <choose> lebten </choose> at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing. 
<choose> alter </choose> rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished 
Neighbours say they were seen <choose> kämpfen </choose> in the street and police were regularly called 
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, <choose> sagte </choose> the family failed to cooperate with the local authority. 
<choose> dem </choose> family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property 
Rubbish and <choose> alte </choose> toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house 
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all <choose> gelebt </choose> at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s. 
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which <choose> umgeben </choose> the house 
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in <choose> privaten </choose> housing in Plymouth. 
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a <choose> klare </choose> warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules. 
'This sends out to those who feel that they can <choose> benehmen </choose> without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said. 
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will <choose> nie </choose> be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities. 
This is the moment terrified tourists <choose> anfangen </choose> to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach. 
<choose> der </choose> incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon. 
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto <choose> sozialen </choose> media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.' 
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it <choose> fühlte </choose> like the plane was going to fall on top of me.' 
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and <choose> flog </choose> at an incredibly low altitude 
The <choose> portugiesischen </choose> Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them. 
He said the jet had flown slightly <choose> tiefer </choose> than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.

In addition, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is <choose> auch </choose> missing.

The <choose> chilenische </choose> international and Ter Steigen have been competing for number one status for two years now.

The US Republicans' lead is plagued by significant fears that they might lose their majority, <choose> auch </choose> in states that are traditionally conservative. 
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to the weaknesses of his election campaign in Utah, formerly a <choose> republikanischen </choose> stronghold. 
After he had beaten 16 rivals from <choose> innerhalb </choose> the Republican camp, doubt is now growing as to whether he will be successful in the race for the White House. 
He blamed false reports on his candidacy, once again giving the media a dressing-down, as he is <choose> bekannte </choose> to do. 
Utah is normally a <choose> sichere </choose> seat for the Republicans. 
Other bodies do put Trump ahead, but not by the margin <choose> üblich </choose> for Republican candidates in the state. 
Arizona and Georgia are <choose> auch </choose> at risk. 
In an interview with broadcaster CNBC, Trump was asked how he would stop Clinton's rise, replying: "In the same way I have <choose> gemacht </choose> before". 
And he added: "Either it'll work out, or I'll go on a long, <choose> langen </choose> holiday". 
If he doesn't make it because of <choose> politischen </choose> correctness, that's ok, Trump added. 
According to press reports, the party have <choose> gedroht </choose> Trump with removing financial support for his election campaign if he is unable to do any better in the polls. 
After an attempt to deceive a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent <choose> einer </choose> coach home. 
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee <choose> umgehend </choose> to investigate the case. 
A Kenyan official announced that <choose> frühere </choose> sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had given a urine sample in the Olympic village in the name of 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich. 
<choose> den </choose> global IAAF federation has requested information about the matter from the IOC so it can carry out its own investigations, stated an IAAF spokesperson. 
"He (Anzrah) <choose> gegangen </choose> to the doping check and alleged that he was Ferguson Rotich, handed in the sample, and signed for it," explained Stephan Arap Soi, Kenya's Chef de Mission. 
He was alleged to have told sportspeople from his country about <choose> anstehende </choose> doping tests in exchange for money. 
According to media reports, he was <choose> festgenommen </choose> on his return at Nairobi Airport.

Ahead of the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a <choose> viel </choose> of pressure on the African country to introduce an anti-doping law and a functioning system of checks.

London schoolgirl who joined ISIL <choose> getötet </choose> in Syria 
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly <choose> starb </choose> in Syria. 
<choose> sie </choose> was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday. 
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, <choose> starb </choose> just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain. 
"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in <choose> gehen </choose> to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said. 
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the <choose> syrische </choose> border.

Treats president Steve Shaw <choose> erzählte </choose> us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."

<choose> die </choose> Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people to arrive at short notice in search of protection, fleeing from Turkey to Germany. 
In the medium term, this <choose> könnten </choose> even grow to "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, President of the association. 
The crackdown instigated by <choose> türkischen </choose> President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to Germany. 
"In the short term I'm expecting ten thousand, in the medium term a few hundred thousand people coming from Turkey looking for protection in Germany, if the Erdogan regime <choose> weiter </choose> to antagonise minorities and democratic opposition," said the President of the Association, Ali Toprak, to "Die Welt" newspaper on Friday. 
A few months ago the government initiated punitive action against Kurdish strongholds - and as a result, 500,000 Kurds are already on the run <choose> innerhalb </choose> Turkey. 
Many will want to seek a <choose> neu </choose> start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Turkey. 
"They are the last big minority in Turkey: the Christian Armenians and the Greeks have <choose> schon </choose> been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU. 
<choose> die </choose> German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad. 
As the newspaper reports, using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup Turks were the largest group granted asylum in Germany on the grounds of <choose> politischer </choose> persecution. 
<choose> das </choose> way things had been going was simply ridiculous: summer holidays, heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another. 
Until 4 September 2016, election day and the last day of the holidays, people in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern <choose> muss </choose> put up with one more election without the people being consulted. 
<choose> das </choose> heated phase, if that can be said at all, has already begun. 
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now <choose> klar </choose> behind the CDU, according to polls. 
Sellering, 66 years <choose> alt </choose> and head of the parliament since 2008, pursued a rather inconspicuous election campaign, as can be seen from his posters. 
Her refugee policies, her "we can manage it" have accelerated the rise of the far-right, he believes - which will <choose> vermutlich </choose> cost him his job. 
<choose> dem </choose> CDU and its top-level candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time. 
"The majority <choose> wahrscheinlich </choose> came from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained to the NDR recently. 
According to Kokert, that will only <choose> spiele </choose> a "minor role". 
<choose> die </choose> Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region, and will have to work hard to connect with the people. 
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had a <choose> klar </choose> victory over the CDU (35.6 percent versus 22 percent). 
Apart from that, the <choose> grüne </choose> are searching out local voters among the holidaymakers. 
At the start of the week, the construction site <choose> konnte </choose> be moved southwards in line with plans, marking the half-way point, and everything is expected to be completed by October. 
<choose> das </choose> obligingness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute driveways. 
Since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday, and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened, and the link to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation <choose> innerhalb </choose> the town has improved. 
"There were some serious complaints made," <choose> sagt </choose> Florian King, deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment. 
<choose> das </choose> commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either. 
"There were considerable infringements," <choose> sagt </choose> King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on. 
<choose> zwei </choose> to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute. 
<choose> der </choose> fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone. 
Bars and restaurants <choose> entlang </choose> the road had been the hardest hit. 
If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go, politicians <choose> wäre </choose> have reacted differently. 
Instead, when Göhner asked the government's president, Jörg Schmidt, if there would be <choose> finanziellen </choose> compensation, the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment. 
Göhner <choose> weiß </choose> of other districts where people have acted more generously. 
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior <choose> sagt </choose> when revealing his new security package. 
Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed <choose> innerhalb </choose> the parties. 
<choose> nach </choose> the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany. 
One thing was already known, announced, heralded: <choose> das </choose> fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new. 
<choose> die </choose> call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise. 
To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove <choose> deutschen </choose> passports from jihadis with dual citizenship. 
"They will be <choose> schwierige </choose> issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician. 
De Maizière also <choose> präsentiert </choose> a few new ideas. 
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or <choose> bewusst </choose> throw away their papers to conceal their identity. 
Some of it is politically and <choose> rechtlich </choose> tricky. 
Some of it <choose> auch </choose> seems half-baked, and leaves questions to be answered. 
Yes, de Maizière says, it is <choose> wichtig </choose> to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism. 
And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - <choose> auch </choose> during election season. 
De Maizière is <choose> auch </choose> trying to strike a conciliatory note here. 
But the SPD is <choose> auch </choose> currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape itself. 
<choose> der </choose> recall has led to fuss about one term. 
Volkswagen's deliveries were more restrained in the <choose> zweite </choose> half of the year. 
<choose> dank </choose> to its number of brands and some well-functioning markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year, despite the diesel scandal. 
In addition, some key markets saw "changed <choose> wirtschaftliche </choose> climates", which led to fewer purchases. 
In the USA, where the emissions scandal <choose> zuerst </choose> began, the books are once again in the red. 
<choose> der </choose> Chinese market is a source of great support for VW. 
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time period, coming to a <choose> weltweit </choose> total of 5.904 million. 
<choose> nach </choose> modification, the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is "as good as a guarantee" but would not talk of an actual "guarantee", as was mentioned on Friday in corporate circles. 
<choose> juristische </choose> intricacies are the reason for this. 
<choose> dem </choose> Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place. 
"Deviations will not be accepted," explained Alexander Dobrindt (CDU), the Federal Minister for Transport, <choose> laut </choose> to the Ministry. 
Volkswagen believes that the broad term "guarantee" could see customers returning to the workshop with motor damage six months after the modification - and being able to blame this on the <choose> neue </choose> software, even if the damage had nothing at all to do with it. 
The Raffeisen Bank in Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from <choose> reichen </choose> savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so. 
<choose> von </choose> September, the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day-to-day account to pay this fee. 
"In the future, any subsequent 100,000 euros will <choose> kosten </choose> 400 euros a year," Paul said. 
The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring <choose> erhebliche </choose> costs". 
It would be "impossible" for them to bear these costs "on a <choose> dauerhaft </choose> basis, from a business perspective". 
Michael Kemmer, managing director of the banking association, said: "We are not expecting that private customers will all have to <choose> bezahlen </choose> fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for that". 
Famous actors, sportspeople and enterpreneurs <choose> wohnen </choose> in the region. 
Spokesperson Ernst <choose> sagte </choose> that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria "was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their expenses". 
<choose> dem </choose> President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June that "the threshold for tipping into the red in terms of private customers is very, very high".

These records, <choose> abgebildet </choose> above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls. 
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his <choose> verfügbaren </choose> income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint. 
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, <choose> frühen </choose> 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says. 
He has, <choose> allerdings </choose> noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records. 
According to Wez, some <choose> älteren </choose> customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular. 
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the <choose> vertrauten </choose> record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories. 
"We're <choose> wie </choose> their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records. 
<choose> die </choose> poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player. 
At this stage of the news report, I would <choose> vermutlich </choose> be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations. 
"Someone <choose> kam </choose> in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says. 
Fopp, which now dedicates almost an <choose> ganze </choose> floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive. 
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to <choose> jemanden </choose> for 30 seconds. 
She is window-shopping, <choose> eher </choose> than on a spending spree. 
It's <choose> leicht </choose> to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh. 
My last stop is a shop <choose> gesagt </choose> to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters. 
It is <choose> reine </choose> "art vinyl." 
These people are <choose> vermutlich </choose> working hard at school or in offices. 
<choose> sie </choose> are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men. 
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of <choose> provisorischen </choose> shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living. 
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had <choose> argumentierten </choose> the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants. 
<choose> der </choose> Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks. 
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals <choose> angeboten </choose> by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp. 
They argued the <choose> provisorischen </choose> shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need. 
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 <choose> provisorischen </choose> shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable." 
<choose> eine </choose> of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp. 
<choose> zwei </choose> charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.

Great Britain's <choose> beeindruckende </choose> run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio. 
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions <choose> gingen </choose> 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner. 
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was <choose> lange </choose> gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands. 
It was <choose> schwer </choose> not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.

Helen Glover and Heather Stanning <choose> inspiriert </choose> to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle 
From the <choose> ersten </choose> stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa. 
<choose> was </choose> we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph. 
I was in hospital and I was walking <choose> herum </choose> the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough. 
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had <choose> verbrachte </choose> a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties. 
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, <choose> sagte </choose> "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot." 
It's been a <choose> fantastische </choose> three years back with Helen and Robin. 
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a <choose> gutes </choose> row and to go out and win that race, which we did.

A <choose> kleiner </choose> Franconian drinking water supply association as a role-model for the large water producers. 
<choose> die </choose> communes of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the municipality of Baunach are also members. 
<choose> aktuelle </choose> chairman, Breitbrunn's mayoress Gertrud Bühl (FW), looks back to when Ruper Göller was brought on as a water officer in 1985, and was promoted to Managing Director of the Association as soon as 1988. 
<choose> sie </choose> pointed out some exceptional successes, including commissioning and opening the new spring (1994), purchasing land near the new spring (1998), compensating farmers, renovating the elevated tanks (1999), creating a new computer management system (2004), and renewing some of the water pipes. 
<choose> aus </choose> his perspective, the high point was the construction of the spring and the restructuring of the Association. 
Even the supply from the new spring was sometimes only <choose> aufrechterhalten </choose> because the elevated tank at Pettstadt was filled by hosepipe. 
<choose> die </choose> management of the Drinking Water Supply Association was passed to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will be Rupert Göller's successor.

A 35-year-old man <choose> geschossen </choose> and fatally wounded his partner on Friday around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargeteheide (in the district of Stormarn). 
"The man himself <choose> angerufen </choose> up and admitted to having shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said. 
This search is now happening across Germany, because Sven S. <choose> könnte </choose> be travelling by car. 
<choose> die </choose> police have now issued a photo of him. 
<choose> allerdings </choose> it is a couple of years old.

<choose> die </choose> police believe he may still be carrying a weapon.

The German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared <choose> zusätzlichen </choose> costs that could have run into the millions. 
<choose> der </choose> sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green energy, but these are now off the table. 
Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) <choose> sagte </choose> the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry. 
"I am <choose> wirklich </choose> delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations." 
<choose> dem </choose> European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy. 
According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with <choose> zusätzliche </choose> costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year. 
Gabriel <choose> sagte </choose> WAZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission, following discussions with Margrethe Vestager, the Commissioner for Competition. 
<choose> diese </choose> too will not be levied against the steel industry. 
<choose> der </choose> agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formalised. 
"It is the <choose> erster </choose> step within our "steel is the future" campaign." 
<choose> seit </choose> the financial crisis of 2008, Europe's steel sector has suffered from overcapacities and considerable pressure in terms of pricing. 
<choose> das </choose> situation only worsened over the past year when the world' biggest producer, China, dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand. 
European manufacturers accuse <choose> chinesischen </choose> steel firms of price dumping. 
<choose> die </choose> situation improved slightly during spring of this year. 
The <choose> deutschen </choose> sector leader, Thyssenkrupp, was cautious on Thursday. 
Thyssenkrupp <choose> auch </choose> did not want to rule out closing individual plants. 
<choose> trotz </choose> rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July. 
At 3.4 million tons, they produced a <choose> gut </choose> six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year, as the steel association reported on Friday. 
The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months <choose> dank </choose> to an improved situation in terms of orders. 
<choose> singt </choose> has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly. 
Singing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reasons, <choose> sagt </choose> Erhard Hackler from the German Association for the Elderly. 
By <choose> regelmäßige </choose> spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts. 
<choose> soziale </choose> and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people. 
This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a <choose> kontrollierte </choose> manner. 
Singing often has a really <choose> besondere </choose> effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations. 
For <choose> älteren </choose> generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains. 
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in <choose> älteren </choose> people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth. 
Song texts, and melodies in particular, can <choose> selbst </choose> be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past. 
<choose> konzentrieren </choose> on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge. 
In particular, older people who live alone can <choose> üben </choose> how to focus on people other than themselves. 
Being able to show yourself that by practising for a <choose> lange </choose> time, you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength. 
If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - <choose> auch </choose> if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests. 
You're not <choose> singt </choose> by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing, who'll hear if a note's out here or there? 
<choose> der </choose> elderly have many options when looking for the right fit, says Hackler. 
If <choose> jemand </choose> you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them. 
To their surprise, the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected - but, compared to their female counterparts, they <choose> immer </choose> acted the same way. 
She is the first author of the study <choose> veröffentlicht </choose> in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" specialist journal this Friday. 
<choose> neun </choose> adult male cats and eight female cats from the MHH's animal husbandry programme were examined. 
<choose> trotz </choose> the low sample size, the researchers believe the results to be significant. 
"All females, <choose> sogar </choose> those who did not have their offspring, were able to differentiate between miaows," said Konerding. 
"One surprise was that the male cats <choose> reagiert </choose> at all," the biologist said.

And <choose> sogar </choose> the fans can agree on that - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas. 
He <choose> abgeschlossen </choose> the season in style, and secured the cup for his team. 
After their knockout in the heats for the Champions League, the "Lions" also left the Europa League <choose> früh </choose> on. 
This is mainly <choose> dank </choose> to Mario Gomez, who laid the groundwork for their fourteenth title with 26 matches in the season as the Süper Lig's star goalkeeper. 
This is <choose> auch </choose> why fans are hoping that the 31-year-old returns. 
However, the star would have to be prepared to give up <choose> rund </choose> a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, as Orman made clear: "We cannot pay the salary that Florenz do". 
<choose> die </choose> issue of doping continues to hit the headlines during the Olympic Games in Rio. 
It was a bizarre scene: <choose> sie </choose> waltzed into the pool with a smile plastered on her face, a deliberately provocative entrance. 
But there are <choose> zahlreiche </choose> other athletes preparing to line up on the start line at the Olympic Games in Rio despite having been involved in doping in the past. 
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): <choose> den </choose> 34-year-old is one of the most controversial track athletes. 
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): <choose> die </choose> two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion was handed a six-month ban in 2010 after she was proved to have taken Oxycodone. 
<choose> die </choose> 29-year-old defended herself by saying she had suffered with bad toothache after an operation. 
<choose> das </choose> year's four longest throws were by the woman tipped for gold. 
LaShawn Merrit (200, 400 4x400m relay/USA): Champion at the Beijing Olympics and two-time 400m World Champion, Merrit <choose> getestet </choose> positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months. 
Ivan Tichon (hammer, Belarus): There is hardly another athlete who has been <choose> nachträglich </choose> stripped of so many medals. 
Liu Hong (20km walking, China): The world record holder and favourite to win gold tested positive as far back as May, but will <choose> trotzdem </choose> be on the start line in Rio. 
<choose> die </choose> 29-year-old world champion revealed traces of a banned dietary supplement, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s ban was lenient, and ended as early as July 13. 
She has some cuts, he says, and was <choose> behandelt </choose> in hospital, but has already been able to leave hospital. 
<choose> sie </choose> plans to return home at the start of September. 
According to Schnöll, the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with <choose> lokalen </choose> authorities as a result. 
Hua Hin, located <choose> rund </choose> 200 kilometres south of the capital city, Bangkok, two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday evening. 
<choose> laut </choose> to police reports, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three people from Holland and three Italians. 
There were another two explosions early on Friday morning, with another person killed, <choose> laut </choose> to the authorities. 
<choose> laut </choose> to the authorities, the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police's territory. 
It is too early to speculate on <choose> möglichen </choose> motives, he says - however, it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels. 
<choose> die </choose> Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country. 
"It is just local sabotage, <choose> begrenzte </choose> to particular areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok. 
Over the past few days, the authorities have <choose> erhalten </choose> notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for. 
The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security <choose> rund </choose> important governmental buildings, along with airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife districts. 
<choose> die </choose> provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, along with Preah Vihear and its surroundings, have been issued with a high security alert (security level 3). 
<choose> den </choose> rest of the country is on an increased security alert (security level 2). 
After several regional authorities had done so, the body charged with protecting the constitution across Germany has <choose> auch </choose> put the group on a watchlist. 
"In terms of the "Identitäre Bewegung" movement, we can <choose> sehen </choose> clear indicators of efforts against the free, democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, to the German press agency in Berlin. 
Bodies protecting the constitution across <choose> neun </choose> federal states - Bremen, Bavarian, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already have the "Identitäre" under observation. 
In general, extremists attempt to speak to them in young people's own language, <choose> oftmals </choose> with pop music. 
In terms of constitutional protection, <choose> mögliche </choose> contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain point, he says. 
<choose> der </choose> groups that have existed to date have arisen on a regional level or via social networks. 
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had <choose> vorher </choose> not been involved in the far-right scene. 
<choose> das </choose> is frightening. 
"This means that many people have committed crimes who <choose> vorher </choose> paid the far-right no heed, who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by far-right sensationalism". 
This is shown by Robel Kiros Habte's <choose> mutige </choose> performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro. 
In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that, sometimes, it was impossible to <choose> sehen </choose> him in the televised images.

<choose> mit </choose> reference to his "flabby stomach", the British tabloid "The Sun" mocked his "Dad Bod". 
His time, almost <choose> einer </choose> minute and five seconds for the 100 metre freestyle, played no part in this. 
Comparisons were <choose> ebenfalls </choose> made with "Eric the Eel". 
<choose> der </choose> performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable: he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own. 
He was 22 years old at the time, and had <choose> lernte </choose> to swim eight months before the Olympics - and had never managed such a long distance before the competition began.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is <choose> kritisiert </choose> as Asian Caricature

In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student <choose> deren </choose> tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least." 
She added that "it's <choose> schwierig </choose> to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects. 
When <choose> einen </choose> of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before." 
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, <choose> entschied </choose> to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same. 
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left <choose> größtenteils </choose> unanswered. 
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but <choose> laut </choose> to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally. 
For her part, Ms. Zhu <choose> sagte </choose> she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K." 
The <choose> vorläufige </choose> report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State. 
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees <choose> amerikanischen </choose> military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia. 
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders <choose> typischerweise </choose> provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said. 
"What <choose> geschehen </choose> at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
<choose> den </choose> 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces. 
For example, a Centcom official stated <choose> öffentlich </choose> that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015. 
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, <choose> bleibt </choose> under the control of the Islamic State. 
<choose> die </choose> report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues. 
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an <choose> übermäßig </choose> insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement. 
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they <choose> gefunden </choose> no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative." 
Last August, <choose> den </choose> New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts. 
The investigation has repercussions <choose> hinaus </choose> the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials). 
<choose> jedoch </choose> last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots. 
<choose> den </choose> critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion. 
Mr. Hooker <choose> auch </choose> played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence. 
<choose> jedoch </choose> the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September. 
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an <choose> übermäßig </choose> positive assessment of the war. 
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown <choose> mit </choose> Britain 
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first <choose> zwei </choose> goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0. 
Here is what she does know: <choose> dem </choose> Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday. 
<choose> beiden </choose> teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second. 
<choose> dem </choose> first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin. 
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing <choose> letzten </choose> among 12 teams at the London Games. 
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., <choose> erste </choose> picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever. 
We've made a <choose> komplett </choose> turnaround. 
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the <choose> dritte </choose> period, when Bam took charge. 
She made a long run with the ball down the <choose> linke </choose> side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead. 
Melissa Gonzalez added the <choose> finale </choose> goal midway through the fourth period. 
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel <choose> beständig </choose> and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving. 
We will always have the breaststroke, and long <choose> möge </choose> it reign. 
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, <choose> lassen </choose> me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline. 
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that <choose> viele </choose> I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all. 
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in <choose> teilweise </choose> because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics. 
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the <choose> zwei </choose> sports it essentially combines. 
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, <choose> bedeutet </choose> "diving board." 
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," <choose> laut </choose> to the official Olympic program. 
Medal hopefuls <choose> müssen </choose> go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court. 
They are <choose> jagen </choose> not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record. 
But it is <choose> auch </choose> what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games. 
He or she rebounds, <choose> scheinbar </choose> weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again. 
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one <choose> wahrscheinlich </choose> to be overlooked in the general melee. 
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up <choose> männlichen </choose> athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base. 
Demonstrators demanding <choose> politische </choose> change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government. 
Witnesses <choose> sagen </choose> that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police. 
In the last week alone, thousands of people <choose> stürmten </choose> into the streets, demanding fundamental political change. 
The government response, <choose> laut </choose> to human rights groups, was ruthless. 
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be <choose> sogar </choose> harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group. 
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa <choose> erhalten </choose> as much Western aid. 
<choose> die </choose> complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power. 
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's <choose> zwei </choose> largest ethnic groups. 
<choose> der </choose> biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas. 
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly <choose> dominiert </choose> by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics. 
Ethiopia's <choose> neuer </choose> prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes. 
<choose> das </choose> result, many fear, is more bloodshed. 
<choose> der </choose> last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole. 
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the <choose> neue </choose> commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty. 
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it <choose> kürzlich </choose> said it closed that base. 
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an <choose> bereits </choose> volatile region to crumble. 
Donald Trump Explains <choose> seine </choose> Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm" 
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the <choose> letzte </choose> controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group. 
<choose> den </choose> clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public. 
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to <choose> erklären </choose> remarks that he might not mean. 
<choose> die </choose> post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge. 
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to <choose> helfen </choose> Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it. 
<choose> der </choose> latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers. 
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to <choose> zurück </choose> to that subject. 
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals <choose> würden </choose> come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring. 
In late July, after he <choose> zog </choose> widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic." 
The approach <choose> erlaubt </choose> Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed. 
"I think it's a pattern of him testing <choose> bestimmte </choose> messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates. 
<choose> aber </choose> I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses. 
While Mr. Trump <choose> generell </choose> tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor. 
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly <choose> stehen </choose> up for him no matter how provocative his remarks. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the <choose> ehemaliger </choose> New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday. 
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, <choose> politische </choose> commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State. 
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being <choose> voreingenommen </choose> against him. 
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who <choose> versuchen </choose> to figure him out and said, "They can't!" 
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is <choose> ungeeignet </choose> to be president. 
<choose> das </choose> store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes. 
<choose> das </choose> artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop." 
A revived Verb Cafe <choose> öffnete </choose> last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location. 
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a <choose> ähnlich </choose> unpretentious vibe. 
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a <choose> neue </choose> outpost, he said he was excited to do it. 
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, <choose> behielt </choose> a lot of things the same. 
Verb <choose> verwendet </choose> the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine. 
<choose> neun </choose> months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars. 
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she <choose> würde </choose> still make the trek. 
After Verb closed, she said, she <choose> gab </choose> up drinking coffee for a while. 
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, <choose> anstelle </choose> of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition. 
"Quarter past seven, <choose> jeden </choose> day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said. 
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he <choose> wollte </choose> to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu. 
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, <choose> mit </choose> the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient. 
And Greenpoint's traditional <choose> polnischen </choose> residents have embraced the cafe as well. 
One of these new customers <choose> übersetzt </choose> the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome. 
A local juice spot <choose> möchte </choose> to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee. 
For many customers, a <choose> neues </choose> Verb to get their old favorites is enough. 
When the <choose> neuen </choose> space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming. 
<choose> der </choose> Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal" 
Mr. Coe's <choose> letztes </choose> book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Showing some <choose> kulinarische </choose> solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929. 
In the years before the Depression, the <choose> amerikanischen </choose> table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could <choose> verstecken </choose> unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce. 
"It was not a <choose> beliebter </choose> addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said. 
As <choose> niemals </choose> before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits. 
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop <choose> wie </choose> creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes. 
"A Square Meal" is a feast of <choose> historischen </choose> tidbits. 
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its <choose> hungernden </choose> citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. 
"He <choose> mochte </choose> to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She <choose> tatsächlich </choose> got people sick." 
Everyone <choose> widerwillig </choose> dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo. 
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group which, <choose> laut </choose> to Bild newspaper, had saved the lives of 60,000 people. 
<choose> jedoch </choose> he never saw himself as a hero, saying, according to Bild: "For me, this is the real jihad." 
"If I were to die saving lives, I would <choose> denke </choose> that God saw me as a martyr."

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years <choose> alt </choose> 
<choose> nach </choose> being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea. 
Greenland sharks <choose> schwimmt </choose> leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour. 
<choose> das </choose> five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal. 
It is <choose> schwer </choose> to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard. 
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of <choose> um </choose> six degrees Celsius. 
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In <choose> einer </choose> animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear. 
<choose> sie </choose> use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age. 
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, <choose> enthielt </choose> less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday. 
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from <choose> kosmische </choose> radiation in the atmosphere. 
<choose> das </choose> is also a world record for vertebrates. 
<choose> der </choose> previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska. 
As a result of <choose> niedrigen </choose> temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible. 
<choose> die </choose> animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters. 
This is because their volume increases <choose> viel </choose> quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat. 
This means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is <choose> viel </choose> bigger than that lost per gram of an elephant. 
"This means that a smaller animal has a more <choose> gefährlicher </choose> life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist. 
<choose> der </choose> commune's council focused on construction-related topics in its most recent session.

"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," <choose> sagt </choose> Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area. 
This is generally used by <choose> große </choose> US banks. 
Several banks have <choose> schon </choose> announced that they will relocate jobs. 
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group <choose> rechnet </choose> to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years. 
According to the IW, the <choose> europäischen </choose> Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further important authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board. 
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can <choose> kommunizieren </choose> directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer. 
<choose> dank </choose> to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to. 
"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," <choose> sagt </choose> Voigtländer. 
In addition, Frankfurt can <choose> biete </choose> better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels. 
<choose> trotz </choose> the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers. 
This is also to do with strength ratios: <choose> gemäß </choose> to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt. 
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck <choose> einschließlich </choose> lying under oath and other unethical practices.

On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not <choose> erlauben </choose> Trump to release them until the audits are complete. 
Trump's critics, including 2012 <choose> republikanische </choose> presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia. 
Clinton has endorsed a rule <choose> benannt </choose> after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.

Conservationists in Tanzania are <choose> verwenden </choose> an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them. 
<choose> dem </choose> method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals. 
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change <choose> innerhalb </choose> these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.

A French filmmaker of <choose> jüdischen </choose> origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers. 
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the <choose> deutsche </choose> outlet FAZ. 
The country <choose> allerdings </choose> was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room. 
<choose> der </choose> reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker. 
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an <choose> sogar </choose> greater disgrace. 
That <choose> bedarf </choose> no explanation. 
<choose> die </choose> incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.

Russian companies are resuming <choose> bestehende </choose> ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market. 
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of <choose> iranischen </choose> tourists to visit Russia this year. 
It's safe to say that last year's record number of <choose> iranischer </choose> tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.

Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome <choose> letzten </choose> night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012. 
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy <choose> machte </choose> his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit. 
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the <choose> fünfte </choose> of his six Olympic golds. 
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly <choose> sechsten </choose> at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired. 
<choose> der </choose> issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff. 
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton <choose> versuchten </choose> to fill. 
Hindes was <choose> knapp </choose> behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on. 
A change of strategy was a <choose> großen </choose> part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace. 
Hoy <choose> sah </choose> on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium. 
There's no <choose> bessere </choose> way to win it. 
He <choose> später </choose> retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals. 
We've been losing out on so <choose> vielen </choose> world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing. 
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a <choose> erfolgreiche </choose> five days in the velodrome awaits. 
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three <choose> olympischen </choose> golds in one Games. 
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that <choose> anscheinend </choose> sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver. 
<choose> den </choose> 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now. 
It's a bit <choose> einsam </choose> winning on your own to be honest. 
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull <choose> qualifizierten </choose> fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit. 
<choose> dem </choose> first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus. 
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the <choose> mittlere </choose> period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals. 
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April <choose> inmitten </choose> sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton. 
<choose> jedoch </choose> on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again. 
<choose> dem </choose> future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed. 
<choose> den </choose> moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant. 
AGL, which supplies the <choose> große </choose> aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements. 
<choose> die </choose> plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares. 
AGL <choose> sagte </choose> the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016. 
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to <choose> beitragen </choose> to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said. 
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the <choose> starken </choose> futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices. 
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle <choose> aufgrund </choose> to the poor economics of the industry. 
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen <choose> sagte </choose> Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts. 
If both of those plants go from the market that's a <choose> erhebliche </choose> reduction in demand in the [electricity] market. 
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and <choose> vierte </choose> daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue. 
<choose> der </choose> cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party. 
It's the cliche plot line of <choose> nahezu </choose> every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow. 
Previous women to feature on the cover <choose> umfassen </choose> Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss. 
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the <choose> frühere </choose> category, she is in pretty good company. 
These celebrities are not relatives of <choose> berühmten </choose> people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things). 
But dwelling on the discontent <choose> scheint </choose> beside the point. 
In Queensland, three out of five people - <choose> meistens </choose> the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation. 
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to <choose> verlieren </choose> another 30 per cent of their federal funding. 
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the <choose> letzte </choose> National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year. 
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning <choose> tausende </choose> of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said. 
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to <choose> erhalten </choose> the help they need. 
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means <choose> tausende </choose> more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help. 
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to <choose> umgehend </choose> reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem. 
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly <choose> zog </choose> a gun 
<choose> der </choose> incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign. 
Bordini said he <choose> gewartet </choose> for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen." 
After <choose> beschwert </choose> to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.

While the red-black ruling coalition in the north might just be able to <choose> weiter </choose> in office, this will not be possible in Berlin, according to the poll. 
However, the SPD was the strongest party in both states, with <choose> gute </choose> chances of putting forward the head of the government. 
<choose> laut </choose> to the poll, this puts the party only slightly above the CDU, who had 23 percent. 
<choose> der </choose> Left and the AfD will fight over third place. 
<choose> trotz </choose> small losses (from 8.7 percent to 6 percent), the Greens will return to Schwerin's regional parliament. 
This would put them <choose> hinter </choose> the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left, with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent). 
Email and the Internet in slow motion: <choose> der </choose> Nokia Communicator was brought to market 20 years ago. 
The device <choose> wog </choose> almost half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5. 
<choose> das </choose> in-built storage originally held eight megabytes - enough today for around two high-resolution selfies. 
<choose> die </choose> "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was released for sale exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone. 
<choose> die </choose> device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros, even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet. 
<choose> jedoch </choose> 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation. 
<choose> der </choose> new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then: it could send and receive SMS messages and emails, and could even be contacted by fax. 
You could even access websites <choose> per </choose> a HTML browser, even though it was painfully slow. 
There was a calculator, a digital address book and an <choose> elektronischer </choose> calendar. 
There was a small antenna, and the phone <choose> konnte </choose> be folded open like a laptop. 
<choose> der </choose> price was fairly high: 2700 deutschmarks, around 1400 euros. 
<choose> der </choose> mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up. 
<choose> heute </choose> the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nokia. 
<choose> für </choose> many people today, being online all day, no matter where you are, is simply a fact of life. 
Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple <choose> alleine </choose> make up 555 million of them. 
This is in addition to the flourishing businesses of <choose> zahllosen </choose> app providers and telecommunications firms. 
The decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007, when the Apple CEO at the time, Steve Jobs, <choose> kündigte </choose> the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World. 
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator - and everything could be accessed <choose> leicht </choose> via touchscreen. 
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and <choose> erweitern </choose> Heathrow 
For our local communities <choose> alleine </choose> we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport. 
Just as there were <choose> voraus </choose> of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great. 
I was told that Britain would be <choose> nie </choose> be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage. 
Expansion is an opportunity to <choose> schaffen </choose> up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK. 
We have a great team at Heathrow who have <choose> umgesetzt </choose> an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways. 
Now they <choose> stehen </choose> ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment. 
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and <choose> erweitern </choose> Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of. 
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," <choose> laut </choose> to one of the companies that makes that software. 
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be <choose> blockieren </choose> ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again. 
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, <choose> laut </choose> to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013. 
"This isn't a good experience for people and we <choose> planen </choose> to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. 
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've <choose> stattdessen </choose> focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.

NASA climate model: Venus was once <choose> bewohnbar </choose> 
Venus was likely once habitable, <choose> laut </choose> to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
<choose> die </choose> model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
Scientists have <choose> zuvor </choose> suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere. 
But the latest simulation suggests Venus <choose> könnte </choose> have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and <choose> geographische </choose> variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation. 
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' <choose> langsame </choose> spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release. 
<choose> das </choose> warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a <choose> suchen </choose> for a new coach immediately. 
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it <choose> benötigt </choose> and bring it to a higher level. 
These conditions are not <choose> momentan </choose> met. 
Sakic, who <choose> angeheuert </choose> Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team. 
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's <choose> beste </choose> coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14. 
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and <choose> fielen </choose> five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference. 
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea <choose> betrieben </choose> by Royal Dutch Shell. 
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a <choose> gemeinsamen </choose> statement read. 
<choose> der </choose> labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent. 
The company's rate reduction <choose> folgt </choose> a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014. 
Shell, for its part, has trimmed <choose> tausenden </choose> of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group. 
<choose> schottische </choose> Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation. 
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we <choose> benötigen </choose> an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement. 
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an <choose> durchschnittlich </choose> of around $7 billion in the past five years. 
<choose> dem </choose> latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster. 
<choose> die </choose> new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation. 
As a star ages, its spin rate <choose> beginnt </choose> to slow down. 
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, <choose> größere </choose> ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones. 
"The Pleiades star cluster <choose> bietet </choose> an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull. 
We still have a lot we want to <choose> erfahren </choose> about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.

Alex Rodriguez' tears ran <choose> schneller </choose> than the US baseball star had run from base to base, in better days.

2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the <choose> erste </choose> doping cases 
Busted: After a sample tested <choose> positiven </choose> for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio. 
<choose> die </choose> first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition. 
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski <choose> getestet </choose> positive in Brazil, and have been excluded. Just before the start of the athletics competition, which has not escaped criticism, this news comes at a bad time. 
The Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is <choose> benutzt </choose> to mask drugs. 
<choose> das </choose> national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision". 
Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old <choose> ging </choose> on the offensive herself. 
She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation <choose> könnten </choose> be food supplements," the athlete explained. 
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and <choose> laut </choose> to BNT, a B sample also tested postive. 
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up <choose> umgehend </choose> to criticise the athlete. 
"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have <choose> schon </choose> been banned". 
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested <choose> positiv </choose> for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother. 
<choose> beide </choose> deny taking it, but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg. 
<choose> der </choose> World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception, for systematic doping, and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Rio. 
"When I look at the podium for the 200m Freestyle, I <choose> will </choose> to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.

Programmers of extortion malware are <choose> aktuell </choose> targeting companies - with success. 
<choose> laut </choose> to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks. 
"We are <choose> aktuell </choose> seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper. 
Finally, the software <choose> präsentiert </choose> the extortioner's demands. 
<choose> der </choose> victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files. 
But while it's a personal photo database that's at play for private users, it's <choose> sensible </choose> customer data or project databases needed for the continuation of projects that are the focus for companies. 
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up <choose> bekommen </choose> their files back. 
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a <choose> gute </choose> reputation. 
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do <choose> versuchen </choose> to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money. 
They explain to their victims <choose> per </choose> chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free. 
Faced with the <choose> potenziell </choose> high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week." 
Malware kits to date, including the malware itself, advice and <choose> zusätzliche </choose> tools, have been sold for a one-off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars. 
Now, <choose> vielen </choose> companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better. 
"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish <choose> sensiblen </choose> files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski. 
In the future, if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory instead of someone's heating, ransomware could <choose> auch </choose> be a issue in Industry 4.0. 
It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does <choose> tatsächlich </choose> prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use. 
<choose> der </choose> HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space. 
The boot is easy to load, but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 2008, which is a <choose> vergleichbaren </choose> model. 
<choose> allerdings </choose> it could certainly do its work a bit more quietly. 
<choose> der </choose> high-beam assistant system is very reliable. 
<choose> die </choose> motors comply with euro 6 emissions standards. 
<choose> das </choose> is because liability only applies for risks typical for aviation travel, the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).

<choose> die </choose> claimants had no luck in court. 
<choose> bis </choose> that date, the organiser had to assume that the seawater was acceptable. 
In addition, no contamination was <choose> gefunden </choose> in water samples.

<choose> dem </choose> major advantage is that traffic will split earlier, improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 51. 
<choose> die </choose> traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5pm and 7pm. 
On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes <choose> auch </choose> goes over it. 
<choose> das </choose> is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße. 
<choose> den </choose> reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lanes, particularly the weight of heavy goods vehicles. 
<choose> den </choose> district authorities deliberately chose the less busy period of the school holidays for the extension of the right-hand turning lane, because it will cause delays. 
<choose> das </choose> international class from the forest school has been to see "The Invisible House" at the theatre. 
The "Nima's" association enables young people from a migrant or refugee background to visit <choose> kulturelle </choose> institutions in Münster. 
The "International Class" at the Kinderhaus forest school saw a performance of the award-winning play "The <choose> unsichtbare </choose> House" at the Young Theatre in Münster. 
<choose> der </choose> association's objective is to encourage cultural integration of young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds, and since the start of the year, it has offered schools with welcome classes with the chance to attend cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project. 
As a result of the increase in the number of refugees, the association is expecting that <choose> vielen </choose> classes will want to take part.

In the evening your mind won't stop whirring, you lie awake for hours each night, and by the time <choose> morgens </choose> comes, sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off. 
If you suffer from these issues, you're in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders, and more than ten percent find that they <choose> häufig </choose> or always wake up not feeling refreshed. 
<choose> viele </choose> people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Association of General Practicioners, who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony. 
<choose> wann </choose> should you see your doctor about sleep disorders? 
If, over the course of a month, you <choose> schläft </choose> poorly for at least three nights a week, and find that this impacts you during the day, you should see a doctor, advises Weeß. 
They can impact in various <choose> unterschiedlich </choose> ways: You could be exhausted, tired, poorly rested, suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert, be irritable, have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches. 
There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the <choose> interdisziplinären </choose> Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin. 
Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a <choose> körperliche </choose> cause. 
You don't have to <choose> vorbereiten </choose> for the examination at all. 
There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a <choose> besseren </choose> night's sleep. 
Weeß lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching <choose> fernsehen </choose> to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all. 
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the <choose> enttäuschenden </choose> performance of the DSV team at the Olympics. 
"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle <choose> bekommt </choose> 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.

Airport: A gang of luggage thieves are <choose> festgenommen </choose> 
The two men and two women had committed multiple crimes since mid-July, and had committed the offences as a group, dividing up their work in a particularly <choose> professionell </choose> way. 
<choose> den </choose> specialists from the 34th police inspectorate were able to prove that the thieves, who had travelled to Germany to commit the crimes, had committed four crimes. 
<choose> sie </choose> had made more than 15,000 euros as a result. 
If you walk along the street from east to west, you <choose> kommt </choose> across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop. 
<choose> jemand </choose> has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house. 
Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is <choose> schon </choose> underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed. 
<choose> der </choose> reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events. 
During this period, builders <choose> renovierten </choose> the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house. 
On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, <choose> einen </choose> day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents. 
On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were <choose> sitzen </choose> on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence. 
<choose> sie </choose> share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification. 
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. <choose> auch </choose> today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city. 
Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including <choose> nahezu </choose> all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer. 
While those on Mainzerstraße were <choose> geräumt </choose> out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago. 
No other street has been mentioned so <choose> oft </choose> this year in connection with "autonomous left-wing violence". 
<choose> der </choose> majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties.
