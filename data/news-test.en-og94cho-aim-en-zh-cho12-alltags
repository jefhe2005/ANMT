<choose> Most <TO> 大部分 <OR> 国家 </choose> of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.

"A <choose> small <TO> ， <OR> 小 </choose> cloth bag with a handful of diamonds, which is very light and can be held in a hand, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media. 
She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both <choose> walking <TO> 小 <OR> 走路 </choose> and sleeping. 
Recently, she <choose> sold <TO> 售出 <OR> 的 </choose> the diamond at a 20% price premium and earned two hundred thousand yuan at a time. 
According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither <choose> supplies <TO> 摘得 <OR> 用品 </choose> nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamonds should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, the people who carry them shall be classified as smuggling and may be sentenced to jail. 
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th <choose> day <TO> 忘掉 <OR> 日 </choose> of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place.

"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most <choose> energy <TO> 能量 <OR> 上 </choose> efficient to launch the vehicle." 
Currently, the Mars has become the <choose> planet <TO> 动作 <OR> 行星 </choose> with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration. 
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a <choose> base <TO> 基地 <OR> 非常 </choose> of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind. 
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of <choose> evolution <TO> 演化 <OR> 成为 </choose> to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc. 
World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of <choose> moon <TO> 月球 <OR> 赛场 </choose> detection. 
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the <choose> Martian <TO> 火星 <OR> 62.198 </choose> atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration. 
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with <choose> high <TO> 2016 <OR> 高 </choose> uncertainty. 
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the <choose> energy <TO> 能源 <OR> 了 </choose> supply for Mars detection. 
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the <choose> high <TO> 高 <OR> 自己 </choose> speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.

With Simmons already showing a good point-forward potential, Embiid <choose> also <TO> 也 <OR> ， </choose> has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor's position is hard to be so solid. 
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's <choose> defense <TO> 防守 <OR> 还 </choose> difficulty. 
<choose> But <TO> 的 <OR> 但 </choose> this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward. This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole.

Officials from the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> 这些 </choose> Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday. 
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior <choose> policy <TO> 政策 <OR> ” </choose> makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> 8 </choose> Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq. 
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to <choose> sell <TO> 出售 <OR> 问题 </choose> oil on the black market.

In the years before the Depression, the American table, <choose> especially <TO> 的 <OR> 尤其 </choose> in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Teams of women cooked for <choose> male <TO> ， <OR> 男 </choose> farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a <choose> creamy <TO> 奶油 <OR> 社会 </choose> coating of sauce.

The legacy is in our continued focus on <choose> calories <TO> 卡路里 <OR> 看到 </choose> and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking. 
The <choose> couple <TO> 夫妻 <OR> “ </choose> said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.

NASA climate model: <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 通过 </choose> was once habitable 
<choose> Venus <TO> 应用 <OR> 金星 </choose> was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for <choose> Space <TO> 。 <OR> 太空 </choose> Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists. 
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less <choose> surface <TO> 表面 <OR> 俄军 </choose> and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
But the latest simulation suggests <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 日 </choose> could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
Early <choose> Venus <TO> 支持 <OR> 金星 </choose> also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer. 
This warms the surface and produces <choose> rain <TO> 在 <OR> 雨水 </choose> that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
The model produced a story of <choose> Venus <TO> 这些 <OR> 金星 </choose> similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
Though likely once habitable, <choose> Venus <TO> 在 <OR> 金星 </choose> was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the <choose> Venus <TO> 极端主义 <OR> 金星 </choose> we know today. 
Researchers shared the results of their new <choose> Venus <TO> 承诺 <OR> 金星 </choose> climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

The latest mission by the Kepler <choose> space <TO> 太空 <OR> 及时 </choose> telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster. 
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to <choose> planet <TO> 的 <OR> 星球 </choose> formation. 
The <choose> latest <TO> 的 <OR> 最新 </choose> catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars. 
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical <choose> models <TO> 果园 <OR> 模型 </choose> of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull. 
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their <choose> latest <TO> 我 <OR> 最新 </choose> analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
