Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed vereinbart . with the BMA.

The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long lang Deshalb war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish türkischen Infrastruktur counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly und kaum oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five fünf kündigt times, according to one report.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian strikt russischen fighter plane on the Syrian border.
The offence was even sogar also greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Russian public öffentliche der opinion has also turned since November.
All of a sudden, it seemed die schien like Turks were to blame for everything.
Russia could konnte geschützten claim a victory of sorts.
First . erster and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
There is also an economic wirtschaftliche es motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly insbesondere der the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved erleichtert beide when flights eventually resume.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish türkischen schützen agricultural imports are permitted again.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted versuchten etwa coup.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel ein fühlen rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite auf trotz the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
Turkey's president deliberately absichtlich der avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely sicherlich Wachstum better that the two leaders are at least talking again.

The interim vorläufige Darmbakterien report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American im amerikanischen military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically typischerweise die provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened geschehen Von at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The den ablehnte 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly öffentlich Probeabstrich that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains . bleibt under the control of the Islamic State.
The betrug die report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly finnische übermäßig insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.

The investigation has repercussions beyond hinaus ekelhaft the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But Vitamin jedoch last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The Neue den critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W.

Mr. Hooker also auch gleichzeitig played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.

Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many nicht viele I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part Ruf teilweise because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two zwei und sports it essentially combines.

They are chasing jagen sie not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.
But it is also auch , what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.

Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated dominiert über by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
Ethiopia's new dem neuer prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.

Donald Trump Explains His seine Zimmerwände Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest letzte nicht controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The den die clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.

The die tieffliegender post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help helfen Luftstreitkräfte Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.

In late July, after he drew in zog widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows erlaubt es Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain an bestimmte messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But als aber I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
While Mr. Trump generally generell befindliche tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand stehen fliegen up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Teil ehemaliger New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political politische gegen commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased ersten voreingenommen against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try versuchen Tage to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit verzichten ungeeignet to be president.

Showing some culinary kulinarische die solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
In the years before the Depression, the American amerikanischen nichtsdestotrotz table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide verstecken 4:1 unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
"It was not a popular eine beliebter addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old alt mit
After nach Als being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea.
Greenland sharks swim schwimmt wie leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.
The das sehr five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
It is hard schwer zu to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around um Korrektheit six degrees Celsius.
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In one einer zu animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They sie gedroht use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, contained enthielt Anstatt less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday.
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from cosmic kosmische : radiation in the atmosphere.
This das Fall is also a world record for vertebrates.
The der in previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska.
As a result of low Betrugsversuch niedrigen temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible.
The Das die animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters.
This is because their volume increases much abgegeben viel quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat.
This means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is much von viel bigger than that lost per gram of an elephant.
"This means that a smaller animal has a more dangerous gefährlicher Weltverband life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist.
