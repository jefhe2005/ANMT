Established in August 2015, Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund, also known as the Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation Cixiao Fund, was initiated by the Hebei <choose> Brand <TO> 不少 <OR> 品牌 </choose> Preparatory Committee. 
"A small cloth bag with a handful of diamonds, which is very light and can be held in a hand, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told her experience in Antwerp last <choose> June <TO> 六月 <OR> 一场 </choose> to the mainland media. 
She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both <choose> walking <TO> 走路 <OR> 都 </choose> and sleeping. 
Recently, she <choose> sold <TO> 所以 <OR> 售出 </choose> the diamond at a 20% price premium and earned two hundred thousand yuan at a time. 
According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither <choose> supplies <TO> 用品 <OR> 有 </choose> nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamonds should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, the people who carry them shall be classified as smuggling and may be sentenced to jail. 
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th <choose> day <TO> 日 <OR> 。 </choose> of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place. 
Teresa <choose> Mei <TO> 梅 <OR> 家门口 </choose> chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that a United Kingdom prime minister chose to go vacation in Switzerland after Margaret Thatcher, according to the United Kingdom newspaper Daily Telegraph. 
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the vacation selection of hotter <choose> places <TO> 康复 <OR> 地方 </choose> by Blair and Cameron 
On June 23, the United Kingdom held a referendum for Brexit, but the <choose> new <TO> 需要 <OR> 新 </choose> prime minister did not want to start the content of article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is related to the exit of member countries from the EU, before the end of the year.

"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most <choose> energy <TO> 因为 <OR> 能量 </choose> efficient to launch the vehicle." 
Currently, the Mars has become the <choose> planet <TO> 行星 <OR> 了 </choose> with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration. 
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a base of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a <choose> second <TO> 第二 <OR> 中 </choose> home for mankind. 
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of <choose> evolution <TO> 演化 <OR> 四年 </choose> to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc. 
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the <choose> Martian <TO> 厉害 <OR> 火星 </choose> atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration. 
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with <choose> high <TO> 高 <OR> ” </choose> uncertainty. 
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the <choose> energy <TO> 。 <OR> 能源 </choose> supply for Mars detection. 
This requires that the detector's sun <choose> wing <TO> 个人全能 <OR> 翼 </choose> area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction. 
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the <choose> high <TO> 高 <OR> 阿里 </choose> speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.

There was also a team of <choose> star <TO> 明星 <OR> ， </choose> coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glories for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the newcomers and cultivated a great number of champions. 
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic <choose> gold <TO> 金 <OR> 他们 </choose> group", and led to win 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games. 
Even if Wade is still one of the league's <choose> best <TO> 最好 <OR> ， </choose> linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Miami Heat.

<choose> But <TO> 适合 <OR> 但 </choose> for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action. 
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is <choose> insulting <TO> 侮辱 <OR> 世纪 </choose> to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before." 
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in <choose> hiring <TO> 顶级 <OR> 招聘 </choose> practices at Snapchat. 
Ms. <choose> Zhu <TO> 朱 <OR> 面向 </choose> criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat. 
Other observers <choose> share <TO> 分享 <OR> 裸体 </choose> her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered. 
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a <choose> private <TO> 私人 <OR> shark </choose> company. 
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company <choose> recently <TO> 近期 <OR> Julius </choose> hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally. 
For her part, Ms. <choose> Zhu <TO> 朱 <OR> 请愿书 </choose> said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K." 
Officials from the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> “ </choose> Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday. 
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior <choose> policy <TO> 政策 <OR> 认为 </choose> makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> 支持 </choose> Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq. 
General Austin <choose> retired <TO> 退役 <OR> 之 </choose> in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel. 
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field <choose> hockey <TO> ， <OR> 曲棍球 </choose> team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0. 
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field <choose> hockey <TO> 曲棍球 <OR> 、 </choose> stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever. 
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a <choose> backhand <TO> 。 <OR> 反手 </choose> shot from close in. 
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the <choose> score <TO> 比分 <OR> 来 </choose> 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge. 
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed <choose> one <TO> 一 <OR> 也 </choose> goal in each of the first three victories. 
The Depressing <choose> Food <TO> 元 <OR> 食物 </choose> of the Depression, in "A Square Meal" 
His menu that day was more humble: deviled <choose> eggs <TO> 录取 <OR> 蛋 </choose> in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding. 
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," <choose> Jane <TO> 珍 <OR> 资助款 </choose> Ziegelman said. 
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are <choose> food <TO> 食品 <OR> 690 </choose> historians. 
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese <choose> cuisine <TO> 通过 <OR> 菜 </choose> in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American <choose> food <TO> 食品 <OR> 2100 </choose> in the Great Depression. 
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills <choose> lunch <TO> 午餐 <OR> 贫困学生 </choose> counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929. 
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a <choose> cream <TO> 奶油 <OR> 绿化 </choose> cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. 
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the <choose> couple <TO> 最 <OR> 夫妻 </choose> deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating. 
"It must have sat in your stomach <choose> like <TO> 表示 <OR> 像 </choose> lead," he said. 
In the years before the Depression, the American table, <choose> especially <TO> 总经理 <OR> 尤其 </choose> in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
It was Americans who had sent <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> 个 </choose> to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty. 
"This was a time when <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> 升级 </choose> became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a <choose> creamy <TO> 公布 <OR> 奶油 </choose> coating of sauce. 
Fresh fruit was replaced with <choose> cheaper <TO> 便宜 <OR> 月 </choose> dried fruit. 
<choose> Strange <TO> 奇怪 <OR> 惩戒 </choose> mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense. 
In researching the book, which <choose> includes <TO> 根子 <OR> 包括 </choose> recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter. 
"It was not a popular addition to the <choose> dinner <TO> 省 <OR> 晚餐 </choose> table," Mr. Coe said. 
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged <choose> women <TO> 女性 <OR> 根本性 </choose> to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes. 
<choose> Especially <TO> 尤其 <OR> 生态环境 </choose> savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. 
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined <choose> like <TO> 像 <OR> ， </choose> the millionaire sophisticate he had become. 
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's <choose> hiring <TO> 约 <OR> 聘用 </choose> of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared." 
The legacy is in our continued focus on <choose> calories <TO> 卡路里 <OR> 组织 </choose> and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking. 
The <choose> couple <TO> 中国 <OR> 夫妻 </choose> said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance. 
"She had a real fear of <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> 将 </choose> waste," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got <choose> people <TO> 人 <OR> 恳谈 </choose> sick." 
<choose> Everyone <TO> 大家 <OR> ， </choose> reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo. 
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped <choose> walnuts <TO> 核桃 <OR> 是 </choose> would help."

"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was <choose> quoted <TO> 引用 <OR> 了 </choose> as saying by Lanzmann.

NASA climate model: <choose> Venus <TO> 成为 <OR> 金星 </choose> was once habitable 
<choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 火星 </choose> was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for <choose> Space <TO> 稀薄 <OR> 太空 </choose> Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists. 
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less <choose> surface <TO> 表面 <OR> 为 </choose> and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
<choose> But <TO> 但 <OR> 月 </choose> the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
This warms the surface and produces <choose> rain <TO> ， <OR> 雨水 </choose> that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
The model produced a story of <choose> Venus <TO> 探寻 <OR> 金星 </choose> similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
Though likely once habitable, <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 气动 </choose> was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 孙泽洲 </choose> we know today. 
Researchers shared the results of their new <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 的 </choose> climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
