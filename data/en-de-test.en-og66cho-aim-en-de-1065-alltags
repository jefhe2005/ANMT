28-Year-Old Chef Found <choose> Dead <TO> wurde <OR> tot </choose> at San Francisco Mall 
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would <choose> want <TO> wollen <OR> '' </choose> to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> bei </choose> body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> , </choose> San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing. 
<choose> The <TO> , <OR> dem </choose> victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago. 
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would <choose> want <TO> wollen <OR> nie </choose> to hurt his younger brother. 
<choose> His <TO> seiner <OR> Bruder </choose> way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.

At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a <choose> bit <TO> bisschen <OR> mexikanischem </choose> of fun. 
"It wasn't a <choose> good <TO> vollkommen <OR> gutes </choose> experience," said Langer. 
It was Langer's <choose> first <TO> erste <OR> ist </choose> time in Aachen, and at CHIO. 
<choose> The <TO> 25 <OR> die </choose> German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> erhält </choose> friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards. 
On Saturday, he met the <choose> first <TO> ersten <OR> sind </choose> person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen. 
"This award means a lot to me," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> bisschen </choose> Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment." 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> eine </choose> two-time US master's champion was inaugurated into the "Hall of Fame for German Sport" on Saturday, along with 15 other outstanding sportspeople.

<choose> Both <TO> sowohl <OR> ich </choose> Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement. 
But the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> Langer </choose> fundamental issue. 
If in doubt, Trump wants the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can <choose> damage <TO> . <OR> schaden </choose> the economy with taxes and regulations. 
He <choose> would <TO> wäre <OR> Am </choose> do things totally differently, Trump says. 
This <choose> would <TO> würden <OR> er </choose> increase taxes for the rich, she says. 
Consequently, Trump <choose> could <TO> könnten <OR> durchaus </choose> lead to discussions within the party. 
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA <choose> back <TO> deutsche <OR> wieder </choose> up. 
Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he <choose> wants <TO> will <OR> An </choose> to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty. 
But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of <choose> international <TO> internationalen <OR> Bundesverdienstkreuz </choose> trade agreements as well. 
Neither <choose> want <TO> wollen <OR> . </choose> to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement. 
At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect <choose> American <TO> Preisträger <OR> amerikanische </choose> jobs better.

They live in the north of Munich, in <choose> one <TO> 15 <OR> einer </choose> of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone. 
There are no men - not <choose> even <TO> auch <OR> Sportlegenden </choose> male visitors. 
"I'm not exaggerating when I <choose> say <TO> sagt <OR> Nach </choose> that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr. 
In their home countries, they experienced <choose> sexual <TO> sexueller <OR> hielt </choose> violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution. 
"Some of the children were <choose> certainly <TO> sicher <OR> all </choose> not conceived with the woman's consent". 
Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given <choose> separate <TO> TTP <OR> getrennt </choose> accommodation, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region. 
Even the European Parliament's Committee on "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" stresses that women must be provided with accommodation <choose> separate <TO> getrennt <OR> sind </choose> from that of the men. 
In a study <choose> published <TO> veröffentlicht <OR> , </choose> on behalf of the Committee, it was stated that "it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation." 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> Wirtschaft </choose> extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich.

Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal <choose> agreed <TO> dagegen <OR> vereinbart </choose> with the BMA. 
It was rejected by 58% of its members who <choose> voted <TO> abgestimmt <OR> massiv </choose> in the ballot. 
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had <choose> remained <TO> geblieben <OR> . </choose> "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected. 
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a <choose> formal <TO> Steuern <OR> formalen </choose> request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September. 
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, <choose> resigned <TO> trat <OR> Infrastruktur </choose> following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended. 
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month <choose> long <TO> Trump <OR> lang </choose> war of words and economic sanctions. 
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his <choose> Turkish <TO> türkischen <OR> größte </choose> counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most. 
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was <choose> hardly <TO> kaum <OR> hochfahren </choose> oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards. 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - <choose> five <TO> fünf <OR> will </choose> times, according to one report. 
The offence was <choose> even <TO> sogar <OR> nicht </choose> greater, coming from a supposed friend. 
Russian <choose> public <TO> beide <OR> öffentliche </choose> opinion has also turned since November. 
Russia <choose> could <TO> konnte <OR> sei </choose> claim a victory of sorts. 
<choose> First <TO> Stunde <OR> erster </choose> and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup. 
There is also an <choose> economic <TO> wirtschaftliche <OR> in </choose> motive. 
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which <choose> usually <TO> üblicherweise <OR> um </choose> carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year. 
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be <choose> relieved <TO> deren <OR> erleichtert </choose> when flights eventually resume. 
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once <choose> Turkish <TO> türkischen <OR> Flucht </choose> agricultural imports are permitted again. 
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the <choose> attempted <TO> gehört <OR> versuchten </choose> coup. 
Turkey's president <choose> deliberately <TO> Ein <OR> absichtlich </choose> avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them. 
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the <choose> two <TO> . <OR> zwei </choose> leaders are at least talking again. 
<choose> The <TO> großen <OR> dem </choose> brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive. 
It has retreated from them <choose> since <TO> seitdem <OR> , </choose> it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. 
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will <choose> get <TO> küsst <OR> erhalten </choose> more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
Each one of those brands will <choose> stand <TO> Szene <OR> stehen </choose> for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands. 
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd <choose> said <TO> gesagt <OR> Träger </choose> we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there. 
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I <choose> think <TO> sind <OR> denke </choose> you're seeing a lot of change.

Three years ago he <choose> initially <TO> anfangs <OR> treibt </choose> struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best. 
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for <choose> many <TO> viele <OR> geht </choose> years. 
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the <choose> prestigious <TO> ist <OR> renommierten </choose> Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy. 
<choose> Later <TO> später <OR> Einige </choose> he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian). 
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had <choose> asked <TO> Oder <OR> gebeten </choose> to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him. 
Sergei Ivanov has <choose> long <TO> lange <OR> , </choose> been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB. 
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with <choose> great <TO> große <OR> München </choose> scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you <choose> could <TO> könnte <OR> geflüchtete </choose> say - troublesome post, for four years. 
Mr Ivanov <choose> took <TO> für <OR> nahm </choose> up the post in December 2011. 
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as <choose> one <TO> . <OR> einen </choose> of the five people he trusted most. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> second <TO> zweiter <OR> wurde </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional. 
Gibson was involved in a <choose> physical <TO> körperliche <OR> allem </choose> altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month. 
I <choose> regret <TO> bereue <OR> Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen </choose> that it occurred," he said in a statement. 
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> Association </choose> to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.

Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now <choose> connected <TO> verbunden <OR> Jahr </choose> to Fife 
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely <choose> precise <TO> präzise <OR> Vertragsbedingungen </choose> tolerances for fit up. 
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be <choose> lifted <TO> gehoben <OR> und </choose> into place on the bridge. 
This was done by pulling the <choose> northern <TO> für <OR> nördlichen </choose> approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards. 
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be <choose> pulled <TO> gezogen <OR> um </choose> up a gradient of about 3%. 
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were <choose> tiny <TO> strahlte <OR> winzig </choose> - just a few millimetres either way.

Firstly, there is the question of who is <choose> actually <TO> eigentlich <OR> wird </choose> going to build the low-cost homes? 
However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to <choose> build <TO> aus <OR> bauen </choose> on private ground?" 
A new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes, which will <choose> cost <TO> kosten <OR> dass </choose> millions, and which still needs to be financed, will trigger concerns. 
The Left <choose> wants <TO> bestritten <OR> will </choose> more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors. 
If the action plan is implemented, the building authorities will be faced with <choose> additional <TO> Zeit <OR> zusätzliche </choose> tasks. 
It is not clear if we will <choose> get <TO> bekommen <OR> . </choose> the specialist staff. 
<choose> But <TO> aber <OR> . </choose> how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years? 
In addition, thought must be given to putting homes <choose> back <TO> Erdogan <OR> zurück </choose> into a price maintenance scenario. 
<choose> The <TO> erschüttert <OR> das </choose> problem could be solved in one fell swoop. 
Around 1800 homes <choose> could <TO> . <OR> könnte </choose> then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> mehrere </choose> only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it. 
This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step <choose> back <TO> wieder <OR> . </choose> from the target of "blending". 
<choose> But <TO> doch <OR> Vedemosti </choose> that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise. 
That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of <choose> many <TO> vielen <OR> gewählten </choose> for the the past decade. 
Screen time was <choose> initially <TO> anfangs <OR> Regimewechseln </choose> limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones. 
So it is <choose> great <TO> sich <OR> toll </choose> to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive. 
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first <choose> created <TO> Dennoch <OR> erschaffen </choose> for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs). 
A generation who played the game when <choose> younger <TO> Stunden <OR> jünger </choose> have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search. 
In the US, the game has <choose> led <TO> gemeinsamer <OR> führte </choose> to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> die </choose> company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels. 
<choose> Many <TO> Bank <OR> viele </choose> public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable. 
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for <choose> something <TO> hat <OR> etwas </choose> to complain about. 
<choose> The <TO> entschieden <OR> die </choose> novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course. 
However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, <choose> helping <TO> helfen <OR> nur </choose> many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier. 
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth <choose> overall <TO> insgesamt <OR> Referenzen </choose> while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever. 
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to <choose> new <TO> und <OR> neuen </choose> heights: 
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - <choose> including <TO> einschließlich <OR> wurde </choose> 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen." 
<choose> One <TO> wurde <OR> einer </choose> last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations. 
Anything less than heading <choose> back <TO> lokale <OR> zurück </choose> to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.

<choose> While <TO> während <OR> ist </choose> Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.

Raisman hugged her gently as they <choose> awaited <TO> Frankie <OR> erwarteten </choose> the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.

<choose> Two <TO> zwei <OR> vor </choose> women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday. 
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was <choose> parked <TO> geparkt <OR> nicht </choose> in a driveway, authorities said. 
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of <choose> one <TO> auf <OR> einer </choose> of the adult victims. 
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two <choose> predominantly <TO> in <OR> vorwiegend </choose> Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.

But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are <choose> maintained <TO> Mrd <OR> aufrechterhalten </choose> by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes <choose> since <TO> Baustelle <OR> seitdem </choose> they started in gymnastics. 
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless <choose> young <TO> Tonnen <OR> jungen </choose> girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. 
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 <choose> urban <TO> urbane <OR> des </choose> youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions. 
It is the inspiration of this team that will send <choose> thousands <TO> fast <OR> tausende </choose> of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great. 
This is such an <choose> exciting <TO> spannende <OR> erste </choose> time. 
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, <choose> strong <TO> starke <OR> Tiefbau </choose> and successful young women. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> end <TO> Dies <OR> beenden </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it. 
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be <choose> damaging <TO> schädlich <OR> waren </choose> for staff and patients. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> alles </choose> first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours. 
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement <choose> last <TO> letzte <OR> sich </choose> night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly." 
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be <choose> made <TO> gemacht <OR> der </choose> and time is running out. 
<choose> This <TO> das <OR> ihrer </choose> is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open. 
If he does not then junior doctors are <choose> clear <TO> deutlich <OR> . </choose> that they are prepared to take further industrial action. 
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of <choose> nearly <TO> Küstenrettungsboots <OR> beinahe </choose> 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> end <TO> diese <OR> beenden </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials. 
The BMA <choose> wants <TO> möchte <OR> seine </choose> better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract. 
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on <choose> already <TO> bereits <OR> Mann </choose> stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families." 
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other <choose> important <TO> wichtigen <OR> alkoholisierte </choose> topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.

Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was <choose> removed <TO> entfernt <OR> ausweisen </choose> from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report 
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so <choose> bad <TO> schlimm <OR> bauen </choose> that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters. 
<choose> The <TO> . <OR> den </choose> report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice. 
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the <choose> broader <TO> Vorschriften <OR> breiteren </choose> culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Verschärfung </choose> report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London. 
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and <choose> illegal <TO> illegalen <OR> werden </choose> practices. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> in </choose> court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia. 
He voiced <choose> particular <TO> Jahresende <OR> insbesondere </choose> alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing. 
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to <choose> prove <TO> beweisen <OR> günstige </choose> who you are 
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and <choose> young <TO> : <OR> junge </choose> people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background. 
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, <choose> including <TO> einschließlich <OR> Diskussion </choose> banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting." 
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for <choose> tougher <TO> härtere <OR> mit </choose> checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud. 
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and <choose> illegal <TO> illegalen <OR> sich </choose> practices," he said.

Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female <choose> Chinese <TO> chinesische <OR> Pokémons </choose> swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race. 
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' <choose> could <TO> konnte <OR> sie </choose> be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'. 
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the <choose> second <TO> zweite <OR> . </choose> leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.

That said, they were <choose> inappropriate <TO> unangemessen <OR> ereignet </choose> and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said. 
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and <choose> attempted <TO> versuchte <OR> zu </choose> to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack. 
'I <choose> would <TO> vereinen <OR> würde </choose> like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'

She did the same with three more pairs before <choose> finally <TO> amerikanische <OR> endlich </choose> deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out. 
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How <choose> disgusting <TO> widerlich <OR> Bronzemedaillengewinnerin </choose> to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'

We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at <choose> close <TO> zwischen <OR> nahe </choose> range. 
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you <choose> twist <TO> verdrehen <OR> zurück </choose> the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him. 
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a <choose> similar <TO> , <OR> ähnlich </choose> technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire. 
At the same time, put weight on the gun and <choose> punch <TO> schlagen <OR> Mannschaftskoordinatorin </choose> the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him. 
But remember that the <choose> safest <TO> sichersten <OR> zuhause </choose> way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.

Since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday, and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened, and the link to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation <choose> within <TO> innerhalb <OR> Vertrages </choose> the town has improved. 
"There were some serious complaints made," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> forderte </choose> Florian King, deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> das </choose> commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either. 
"There were considerable infringements," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> und </choose> King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on. 
<choose> Two <TO> Tag- <OR> zwei </choose> to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> empfohlen </choose> fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone. 
This is only a <choose> small <TO> kleiner <OR> eines </choose> consolation for businesses located along the B 27 that the road has reopened for customers from Rottenburg. 
Bars and restaurants <choose> along <TO> entlang <OR> in </choose> the road had been the hardest hit. 
If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go, politicians <choose> would <TO> wäre <OR> . </choose> have reacted differently. 
Instead, when Göhner asked the government's president, Jörg Schmidt, if there would be <choose> financial <TO> finanziellen <OR> das </choose> compensation, the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment. 
Göhner <choose> knows <TO> weiß <OR> bereits </choose> of other districts where people have acted more generously. 
After all, the family business moved there back in 1715, he said, referring to its <choose> long <TO> lange <OR> Einnahme </choose> history. 
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior <choose> said <TO> einen <OR> sagt </choose> when revealing his new security package. 
<choose> After <TO> nach <OR> Reduzierung </choose> the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany. 
One thing was <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> Sicherheit </choose> known, announced, heralded: The fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new. 
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies <choose> also <TO> ebenso <OR> aufblühen </choose> does not come as a surprise. 
To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove <choose> German <TO> deutschen <OR> wegen </choose> passports from jihadis with dual citizenship. 
"They will be <choose> difficult <TO> um <OR> schwierige </choose> issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician. 
De Maizière also <choose> presented <TO> empfiehlt <OR> präsentiert </choose> a few new ideas. 
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who <choose> commit <TO> aufzutragen <OR> begehen </choose> crimes, or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity. 
Yes, de Maizière says, it is <choose> important <TO> wichtig <OR> Schutz </choose> to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism. 
And things that <choose> deeply <TO> zutiefst <OR> Er </choose> worry people cannot be ignored - even during election season.

<choose> Thanks <TO> sich <OR> dank </choose> to its number of brands and some well-functioning markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year, despite the diesel scandal. 
Globally, the VW brand <choose> sold <TO> das <OR> verkaufte </choose> 449,100 cars in July - 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month in the previous year.

<choose> From <TO> von <OR> eine </choose> September, the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day-to-day account to pay this fee. 
"In the future, any subsequent 100,000 euros will <choose> cost <TO> kosten <OR> bearbeiten </choose> 400 euros a year," Paul said. 
It would be far too dangerous just to leave the cash in the Raffeisen Bank's safe: "I have <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> in </choose> been through four raids, I don't want a fifth!" the bank's managing director said. 
The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring <choose> significant <TO> erhebliche <OR> dass </choose> costs". 
It would be "impossible" for them to bear these costs "on a <choose> permanent <TO> dauerhaft <OR> und </choose> basis, from a business perspective". 
Michael Kemmer, managing director of the banking association, said: "We are not expecting that private customers will all have to <choose> pay <TO> bezahlen <OR> die </choose> fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for that".

It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: <choose> older <TO> ältere <OR> beeindruckende </choose> vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%). 
While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by <choose> independent <TO> kämpfende <OR> unabhängige </choose> sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.

These records, <choose> pictured <TO> abgebildet <OR> . </choose> above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls. 
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his <choose> disposable <TO> verfügbaren <OR> soll </choose> income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint. 
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was <choose> probably <TO> vermutlich <OR> im </choose> a bit too young to get," he says. 
He has, <choose> however, <TO> allerdings <OR> '' </choose> noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.

A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> , </choose> shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living. 
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had <choose> argued <TO> argumentierten <OR> noch </choose> the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> wurde </choose> Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks. 
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the <choose> growing <TO> wachsenden <OR> sich </choose> numbers at the camp. 
They argued the <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> . </choose> shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need. 
A Lille court ruled there was no <choose> legal <TO> rechtliche <OR> entschuldigte </choose> basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable." 
<choose> One <TO> ebenfalls <OR> eine </choose> of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.

<choose> From <TO> aus <OR> Probeabstrich </choose> his perspective, the high point was the construction of the spring and the restructuring of the Association.

<choose> The <TO> der <OR> £50.000 </choose> sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green energy, but these are now off the table. 
Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) <choose> told <TO> sagte <OR> Trebilcock </choose> the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry. 
<choose> The <TO> Anwesen <OR> dem </choose> European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy.

By <choose> regularly <TO> Housing <OR> regelmäßige </choose> spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts.

This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a <choose> controlled <TO> kontrollierte <OR> ist </choose> manner. 
For <choose> older <TO> schrecklich <OR> älteren </choose> generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains.

"In terms of the "Identitäre Bewegung" movement, we can <choose> see <TO> sehen <OR> Donald </choose> clear indicators of efforts against the free, democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, to the German press agency in Berlin.

In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student <choose> whose <TO> deren <OR> sagte </choose> tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least." 
She added that "it's <choose> hard <TO> schwierig <OR> der </choose> to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.

On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, <choose> decided <TO> Donald <OR> entschied </choose> to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same. 
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left <choose> largely <TO> größtenteils <OR> Treats </choose> unanswered.

The <choose> interim <TO> . <OR> vorläufige </choose> report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State. 
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees <choose> American <TO> amerikanischen <OR> Shaw </choose> military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia. 
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders <choose> typically <TO> typischerweise <OR> Frauen </choose> provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said. 
"What <choose> happened <TO> Kunstwerk <OR> geschehen </choose> at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
The 10-page report <choose> detailed <TO> detailliert <OR> . </choose> persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces. 
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were <choose> significantly <TO> : <OR> deutlich </choose> more positive than actual events," the report said. 
For example, a Centcom official stated <choose> publicly <TO> öffentlich <OR> Schutzsuchenden </choose> that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015. 
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, <choose> remains <TO> . <OR> bleibt </choose> under the control of the Islamic State. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> eine </choose> report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues. 
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an <choose> overly <TO> übermäßig <OR> Deutschland </choose> insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement. 
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or <choose> political <TO> vereitelten <OR> politischen </choose> narrative." 
Last August, <choose> The <TO> den <OR> sie </choose> New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts. 
The investigation has repercussions <choose> beyond <TO> hinaus <OR> im </choose> the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials). 
<choose> But <TO> jedoch <OR> erhöhen </choose> last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> sind </choose> critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion. 
<choose> But <TO> jedoch <OR> Der </choose> the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September. 
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an <choose> overly <TO> übermäßig <OR> der </choose> positive assessment of the war. 
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown <choose> With <TO> mit <OR> Türken </choose> Britain 
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first <choose> two <TO> zwei <OR> anpasst </choose> goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0. 
Here is what she does know: <choose> The <TO> die <OR> Deutschland </choose> Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday. 
<choose> Both <TO> finden <OR> beiden </choose> teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> sind </choose> first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin. 
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing <choose> last <TO> letzten <OR> , </choose> among 12 teams at the London Games. 
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., <choose> first <TO> erste <OR> sie </choose> picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever. 
We've made a <choose> complete <TO> komplett <OR> direkt </choose> turnaround. 
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the <choose> third <TO> dritte <OR> geht </choose> period, when Bam took charge. 
She made a long run with the ball down the <choose> left <TO> sollen <OR> linke </choose> side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead. 
Melissa Gonzalez added the <choose> final <TO> Usedom <OR> finale </choose> goal midway through the fourth period. 
<choose> The <TO> , <OR> die </choose> shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories. 
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel <choose> constant <TO> zum <OR> beständig </choose> and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving. 
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in <choose> Olympic <TO> Phase <OR> olympischen </choose> trampoline. 
We will always have the breaststroke, and long <choose> may <TO> möge <OR> einer </choose> it reign. 
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, <choose> let <TO> liegt <OR> lassen </choose> me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline. 
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that <choose> many <TO> wie <OR> viele </choose> I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all. 
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in <choose> part <TO> teilweise <OR> einen </choose> because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics. 
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the <choose> two <TO> bekommen <OR> zwei </choose> sports it essentially combines. 
The word "trampoline" derives from the <choose> Spanish <TO> spanischen <OR> Amt </choose> el trampolín, meaning "diving board." 
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to <choose> nearly <TO> fast <OR> Spitzenkandidaten </choose> 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet. 
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> Kanzlerin </choose> to the official Olympic program. 
But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about <choose> even <TO> Mecklenburger <OR> selbst </choose> watching the Games. 
He or she rebounds, <choose> seeming <TO> schade <OR> scheinbar </choose> weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again. 
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, <choose> also <TO> verzichtet <OR> ebenfalls </choose> at 1. 
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one <choose> likely <TO> wahrscheinlich <OR> so </choose> to be overlooked in the general melee. 
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up <choose> male <TO> sehr <OR> männlichen </choose> athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base. 
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with <choose> violent <TO> . <OR> gewalttätigen </choose> resistance by the government. 
Witnesses <choose> say <TO> sagen <OR> : </choose> that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police. 
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be <choose> even <TO> sogar <OR> Partner </choose> harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group. 
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa <choose> receive <TO> Umfragen <OR> erhalten </choose> as much Western aid. 
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly <choose> cited <TO> der <OR> angeführt </choose> the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Landesvorsitzende </choose> complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power. 
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's <choose> two <TO> zwei <OR> Seen </choose> largest ethnic groups. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> . </choose> biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas. 
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly <choose> dominated <TO> Sperrung <OR> dominiert </choose> by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics. 
"The current regime <choose> lacks <TO> fehlt <OR> , </choose> that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said. 
Ethiopia's <choose> new <TO> neuer <OR> . </choose> prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> auch </choose> result, many fear, is more bloodshed. 
<choose> The <TO> . <OR> der </choose> last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole. 
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the <choose> new <TO> neue <OR> Der </choose> commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty. 
But clearly that has not stopped the <choose> internal <TO> internen <OR> gab </choose> resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying. 
While the West clearly wants to <choose> support <TO> unterstützen <OR> ihrem </choose> democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble. 
Donald Trump Explains <choose> His <TO> seine <OR> wurden </choose> Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm" 
Donald J. Trump <choose> tried <TO> versuchte <OR> kundig </choose> to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> zwei </choose> clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public. 
<choose> The <TO> in <OR> der </choose> post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge. 
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to <choose> help <TO> gern <OR> helfen </choose> Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> für </choose> latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers. 
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to <choose> return <TO> zurück <OR> Rückgang </choose> to that subject. 
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals <choose> would <TO> würden <OR> sind </choose> come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring. 
In late July, after he <choose> drew <TO> zog <OR> schon </choose> widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic." 
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it <choose> back <TO> zurück <OR> die </choose> as needed. 
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" <choose> one <TO> Umsatz <OR> eine </choose> way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates. 
<choose> But <TO> aber <OR> er </choose> I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses. 
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll <choose> released <TO> '' <OR> veröffentlicht </choose> on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida. 
While Mr. Trump <choose> generally <TO> generell <OR> Politik </choose> tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor. 
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly <choose> stand <TO> stehen <OR> es </choose> up for him no matter how provocative his remarks. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the <choose> former <TO> so <OR> ehemaliger </choose> New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday. 
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> die </choose> when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State. 
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who <choose> try <TO> verstehen <OR> versuchen </choose> to figure him out and said, "They can't!" 
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is <choose> unfit <TO> ungeeignet <OR> es </choose> to be president. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> daran </choose> artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."

In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, <choose> using <TO> mit <OR> an </choose> the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.

One of these new customers <choose> translated <TO> verschlüsselter <OR> übersetzt </choose> the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.

Mr. Coe's <choose> last <TO> letztes <OR> Koalitionspartner </choose> book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."

In the years before the Depression, the <choose> American <TO> Land <OR> amerikanischen </choose> table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could <choose> hide <TO> verstecken <OR> bei </choose> unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.

"He <choose> liked <TO> mochte <OR> : </choose> to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She <choose> actually <TO> tatsächlich <OR> Ansbach </choose> got people sick." 
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had <choose> prepared <TO> zubereitet <OR> Wahlkämpfe </choose> at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years <choose> old <TO> alt <OR> ist </choose> 
<choose> After <TO> nach <OR> Es </choose> being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea. 
Greenland sharks <choose> swim <TO> schwimmt <OR> . </choose> leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> die </choose> five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal. 
It is <choose> hard <TO> läuft <OR> schwer </choose> to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard. 
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of <choose> around <TO> um <OR> gibt </choose> six degrees Celsius. 
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> verhaltener </choose> animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear. 
<choose> They <TO> sie <OR> Europa </choose> use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age. 
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, <choose> contained <TO> enthielt <OR> . </choose> less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday. 
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from <choose> cosmic <TO> kosmische <OR> betroffene </choose> radiation in the atmosphere. 
<choose> This <TO> konnte <OR> das </choose> is also a world record for vertebrates. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> rund </choose> previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska. 
As a result of low temperatures, the systems of the animals living there <choose> often <TO> häufig <OR> keinerlei </choose> run on as little energy as possible. 
<choose> The <TO> hätten <OR> die </choose> animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters. 
"This means that a smaller animal has a more <choose> dangerous <TO> gefährlicher <OR> erfüllen </choose> life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> keine </choose> commune's council focused on construction-related topics in its most recent session.

The city on the river Main will soon have the <choose> best <TO> besten <OR> Garantie </choose> chance against the competition of Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London. 
"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> Institut </choose> Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area. 
This is generally used by <choose> large <TO> große <OR> Millionen </choose> US banks.

The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group <choose> expects <TO> rechnet <OR> ersten </choose> to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years. 
According to the IW, the <choose> European <TO> `` <OR> europäischen </choose> Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further important authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board. 
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can <choose> communicate <TO> 0,4 <OR> kommunizieren </choose> directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer. 
While Luxembourg is home to a <choose> large <TO> große <OR> Die </choose> funds industry, like Dublin, its infrastructure lets it down. 
"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> Bargeld </choose> Voigtländer. 
In addition, Frankfurt can <choose> offer <TO> hätten <OR> biete </choose> better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels.

This is also to do with strength ratios: <choose> According <TO> Einlagen <OR> gemäß </choose> to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt. 
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck <choose> including <TO> Banken <OR> einschließlich </choose> lying under oath and other unethical practices.

A French filmmaker of <choose> Jewish <TO> jüdischen <OR> Laster </choose> origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers. 
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the <choose> German <TO> deutsche <OR> der </choose> outlet FAZ. 
The country <choose> however <TO> . <OR> allerdings </choose> was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.

Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome <choose> last <TO> letzten <OR> dass </choose> night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012. 
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy <choose> made <TO> gemacht <OR> , </choose> his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit. 
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly <choose> sixth <TO> sechsten <OR> das </choose> at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> `` </choose> issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.

A change of strategy was a <choose> big <TO> großen <OR> wir </choose> part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace. 
Hoy <choose> watched <TO> sah <OR> 54,5 </choose> on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium. 
There's no <choose> better <TO> Tennisprofi <OR> bessere </choose> way to win it. 
He <choose> later <TO> später <OR> 34 </choose> retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.

If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a <choose> successful <TO> ( <OR> erfolgreiche </choose> five days in the velodrome awaits. 
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three <choose> Olympic <TO> olympischen <OR> die </choose> golds in one Games. 
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that <choose> seemingly <TO> anscheinend <OR> Medaille </choose> sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.

<choose> The <TO> den <OR> wie </choose> future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed. 
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes <choose> around <TO> rund <OR> die </choose> 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output. 
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure <choose> last <TO> . <OR> letztes </choose> year of the Anglesea power plant. 
<choose> The <TO> . <OR> den </choose> moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant. 
AGL, which supplies the <choose> big <TO> Amazon <OR> große </choose> aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements. 
<choose> The <TO> zur <OR> die </choose> plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares. 
AGL <choose> said <TO> sagte <OR> Hier </choose> the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016. 
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to <choose> contribute <TO> beitragen <OR> müssen </choose> to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said. 
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the <choose> strong <TO> starken <OR> fünf </choose> futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices. 
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to <choose> operate <TO> sowie <OR> betreiben </choose> the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter." 
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle <choose> due <TO> aufgrund <OR> Hersteller </choose> to the poor economics of the industry.

The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means <choose> thousands <TO> hat <OR> tausende </choose> more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help. 
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to <choose> immediately <TO> Mitchell <OR> umgehend </choose> reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.

Expansion is an opportunity to <choose> create <TO> schaffen <OR> , </choose> up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK. 
Now they <choose> stand <TO> stehen <OR> gewinnen </choose> ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> eine </choose> London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too. 
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and <choose> expand <TO> erweitern <OR> , </choose> Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of. 
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> sie </choose> to one of the companies that makes that software. 
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be <choose> blocking <TO> für <OR> blockieren </choose> ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again. 
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, <choose> according <TO> geht <OR> laut </choose> to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013. 
Desktop ads still account for <choose> enough <TO> genügend <OR> vorbildlich </choose> revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment. 
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be <choose> updating <TO> aktualisieren <OR> Wasserproduzenten </choose> its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them. 
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's <choose> new <TO> neue <OR> vor </choose> filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site. 
"This isn't a good experience for people and we <choose> plan <TO> planen <OR> Unterfranken </choose> to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. 
Clearly looking to <choose> kill <TO> vorbildlich <OR> töten </choose> herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.

NASA climate model: Venus was once <choose> habitable <TO> bewohnbar <OR> Für </choose> 
Venus was likely once habitable, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> ( </choose> to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> zu </choose> model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
But the <choose> latest <TO> neueste <OR> im </choose> simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
<choose> This <TO> das <OR> Leben </choose> warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution <choose> previously <TO> zuvor <OR> Nitratsenkung </choose> hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a <choose> thick <TO> waren <OR> dicke </choose> atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today. 
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a <choose> search <TO> Januar <OR> suchen </choose> for a new coach immediately. 
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it <choose> needs <TO> benötigt <OR> die </choose> and bring it to a higher level. 
These conditions are not <choose> currently <TO> momentan <OR> Stürmer </choose> met. 
Sakic, who <choose> hired <TO> angeheuert <OR> sie </choose> Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team. 
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's <choose> best <TO> beste <OR> aber </choose> coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14. 
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last <choose> two <TO> Mensch <OR> beiden </choose> years.

Shell, for its part, has trimmed <choose> thousands <TO> , <OR> tausenden </choose> of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group. 
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an <choose> economic <TO> wirtschaftliche <OR> . </choose> situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union. 
<choose> Scottish <TO> schottische <OR> Glatze </choose> Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation. 
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we <choose> need <TO> Polizei <OR> benötigen </choose> an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.

<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> `` </choose> latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> , </choose> new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation. 
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of <choose> recognizable <TO> zunächst <OR> erkennbaren </choose> starspots -- like sunspots. 
The <choose> latest <TO> einen <OR> neueste </choose> catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars. 
"The Pleiades star cluster <choose> provides <TO> bietet <OR> am </choose> an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull. 
We still have a lot we want to <choose> learn <TO> für <OR> erfahren </choose> about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.

2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the <choose> first <TO> nun <OR> erste </choose> doping cases 
Busted: After a sample tested <choose> positive <TO> Aber <OR> positiven </choose> for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> festgeschrieben </choose> first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition. 
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski <choose> tested <TO> getestet <OR> . </choose> positive in Brazil, and have been excluded. Just before the start of the athletics competition, which has not escaped criticism, this news comes at a bad time. 
The Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is <choose> used <TO> benutzt <OR> ein </choose> to mask drugs. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> Emissionsrechtehandels </choose> national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision". 
<choose> For <TO> für <OR> Überkapazitäten </choose> the first time in history, the CAS, not the IOC, is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople who test positive. 
Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old <choose> went <TO> ging <OR> Stahl </choose> on the offensive herself. 
"I had three tests, all of which were negative, and my <choose> fourth <TO> Laufe <OR> vierter </choose> test was positive," which was "an unbelievable shock," she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT. 
She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation <choose> could <TO> sich <OR> könnten </choose> be food supplements," the athlete explained. 
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> vorsichtig </choose> to BNT, a B sample also tested postive. 
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up <choose> immediately <TO> umgehend <OR> die </choose> to criticise the athlete. 
"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> . </choose> been banned". 
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested <choose> positive <TO> waren <OR> positiv </choose> for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother. 
<choose> Both <TO> deutschen <OR> beide </choose> deny taking it, but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg. 
<choose> The <TO> Rohstahl <OR> den </choose> World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception, for systematic doping, and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Rio.

Programmers of extortion malware are <choose> currently <TO> Singen <OR> aktuell </choose> targeting companies - with success. 
<choose> According <TO> laut <OR> im </choose> to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks. 
If they are successful in that domain, the ransom money they can demand is <choose> significantly <TO> deutlich <OR> `` </choose> higher than it would be for private users. 
"We are <choose> currently <TO> aktuell <OR> und </choose> seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper. 
Finally, the software <choose> presents <TO> präsentiert <OR> pflegen </choose> the extortioner's demands. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> ein </choose> victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files. 
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up <choose> get <TO> Zusammenseins <OR> bekommen </choose> their files back. 
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a <choose> good <TO> gute <OR> Sinne </choose> reputation. 
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do <choose> try <TO> versuchen <OR> kontrollierte </choose> to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money. 
They explain to their victims <choose> via <TO> per <OR> . </choose> chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free. 
"The kits <choose> include <TO> darum <OR> enthalten </choose> an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be constructed, and the appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. 
Now, <choose> many <TO> vielen <OR> Schule </choose> companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better. 
"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish <choose> sensitive <TO> sensiblen <OR> Erinnerungen </choose> files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski. 
In the future, if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory <choose> instead <TO> anstatt <OR> selbst </choose> of someone's heating, ransomware could also be a issue in Industry 4.0. 
It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does <choose> indeed <TO> wird <OR> tatsächlich </choose> prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use. 
<choose> The <TO> auf <OR> der </choose> HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space. 
The boot is easy to load, but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 2008, which is a <choose> comparable <TO> vergleichbaren <OR> , </choose> model.

<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> Übersichten </choose> claimant had broken a kneecap in the fall. 
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was <choose> one <TO> ein <OR> direkt </choose> of the ordinary risks of life, pronounced the court. 
Travellers who fall ill will only <choose> get <TO> Viele <OR> bekommen </choose> their money back when they return home if there is no doubt that their illness was caused by something within their hotel. 
They <choose> spent <TO> verbrachte <OR> , </choose> almost all their holiday in their room. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> etwas </choose> family took the opinion that the holiday was unsatisfactory - and took the organiser to court. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Kater </choose> claimants had no luck in court. 
<choose> Until <TO> Überraschung <OR> bis </choose> that date, the organiser had to assume that the seawater was acceptable. 
In addition, no contamination was <choose> found <TO> und <OR> gefunden </choose> in water samples. 
When several hotel guests fall ill - possibly by infecting each other - the court views this as a <choose> general <TO> auf <OR> allgemeinen </choose> life risk.

<choose> The <TO> die <OR> mit </choose> traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5pm and 7pm. 
On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes <choose> even <TO> auch <OR> die </choose> goes over it. 
<choose> This <TO> das <OR> ganz </choose> is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße.

In the evening your mind won't stop whirring, you lie awake for hours each night, and by the time <choose> morning <TO> morgens <OR> Ausnahmezustand </choose> comes, sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off. 
If you suffer from these issues, you're in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders, and more than ten percent find that they <choose> often <TO> häufig <OR> im </choose> or always wake up not feeling refreshed. 
<choose> Many <TO> das <OR> viele </choose> people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Association of General Practicioners, who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony. 
<choose> When <TO> wann <OR> Arbeiterclubs </choose> should you see your doctor about sleep disorders? 
If, over the course of a month, you <choose> sleep <TO> schläft <OR> eint </choose> poorly for at least three nights a week, and find that this impacts you during the day, you should see a doctor, advises Weeß. 
They can impact in various <choose> different <TO> unterschiedlich <OR> - </choose> ways: You could be exhausted, tired, poorly rested, suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert, be irritable, have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches. 
There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the <choose> Interdisciplinary <TO> Gala <OR> interdisziplinären </choose> Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin. 
Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a <choose> physical <TO> körperliche <OR> Fenerbahce </choose> cause. 
Who should go to a sleep lab, and what <choose> happens <TO> passiert <OR> ihn </choose> there? 
You don't have to <choose> prepare <TO> vorbereiten <OR> seiner </choose> for the examination at all. 
There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a <choose> better <TO> besseren <OR> Dank </choose> night's sleep. 
Weeß lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching <choose> television <TO> fernsehen <OR> früh </choose> to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all. 
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the <choose> disappointing <TO> enttäuschenden <OR> . </choose> performance of the DSV team at the Olympics. 
"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle <choose> gets <TO> bekommt <OR> wir </choose> 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.

Airport: A gang of luggage thieves are <choose> arrested <TO> festgenommen <OR> Vor </choose> 
Around 9.30 p.m. civil servants in Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang <choose> known <TO> bekannt <OR> auf </choose> to the police from previous thefts. 
The two men and two women had committed multiple crimes since mid-July, and had committed the offences as a group, dividing up their work in a particularly <choose> professional <TO> professionell <OR> seines </choose> way. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> haben </choose> specialists from the 34th police inspectorate were able to prove that the thieves, who had travelled to Germany to commit the crimes, had committed four crimes. 
<choose> They <TO> sie <OR> gesperrt </choose> had made more than 15,000 euros as a result. 
If you walk along the street from east to west, you <choose> come <TO> starten <OR> kommt </choose> across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop. 
<choose> Someone <TO> lachen <OR> jemand </choose> has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house. 
Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is <choose> already <TO> ausgepfiffen <OR> schon </choose> underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Es </choose> reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events. 
Berlin's Senator of the Interior Henkel had called multiple times since the start of the year for the police to take a hard line against the project that has made the area a "no-go zone" for police and singled out 94 as the starting point for <choose> autonomous <TO> autonomer <OR> den </choose> violence. 
During this period, builders <choose> renovated <TO> renovierten <OR> : </choose> the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house. 
On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, <choose> one <TO> einen <OR> . </choose> day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents. 
On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were <choose> sitting <TO> als <OR> sitzen </choose> on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence. 
<choose> They <TO> sie <OR> verbotene </choose> share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification. 
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. <choose> Even <TO> auch <OR> 21 </choose> today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city. 
Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including <choose> almost <TO> beteuerte <OR> nahezu </choose> all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer. 
While those on Mainzerstraße were <choose> cleared <TO> geräumt <OR> Hammerwurf </choose> out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Tichon </choose> majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> er </choose> trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite: "Here we help each other, live together along the street, and talk to each other more than elsewhere". 
<choose> She <TO> Mit <OR> sie </choose> will also work on-site as a social worker. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Mai </choose> social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger. 
Regine Kunde from the working group said that the volunteers are more than <choose> grateful <TO> Jahre <OR> dankbar </choose> that Deuschle is now available to work as a jack-of-all-trades to help anyone experiencing difficulties. 
The 31-year-old has been in post for <choose> around <TO> in <OR> rund </choose> six weeks. 
De facto, the administration cannot <choose> find <TO> , <OR> findet </choose> any private homes. 
Many people work in builder's yards or help caretakers, or do voluntary work - and that provides <choose> motivation <TO> motiviert <OR> diesbezüglich </choose> in a very orderly way, as Annika Deuschle reports. 
<choose> She <TO> zwei <OR> sie </choose> says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in Germany. 
<choose> They <TO> sie <OR> verletzt </choose> have to explain to refugees that it will take that long, and that the time can be filled productively - for example, with language courses. 
If someone feels that they can't help anyone in Urbach, that they aren't allowed to work, and that they are useless, they'll <choose> never <TO> nie <OR> , </choose> integrate. 
But there are also problem cases, Kunde <choose> says <TO> Auch <OR> sagt </choose> honestly, "people for whom nothing works". As a result, Deuschle and Kunde's work will always be to motivate others. 
<choose> All <TO> alles <OR> Nähe </choose> told, this is "a mammoth task". 
"No," Regine Kunde <choose> said <TO> eine <OR> sagt </choose> clearly, "which some people might call naive". She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining. 
Many of them <choose> would <TO> würden <OR> sei </choose> like to stay in Urbach. 
But they always have in the back of their mind that a <choose> new <TO> neuer <OR> . </choose> group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Urbach. 
"In Urbach we've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet," <choose> said <TO> aus <OR> sagt </choose> Annika Deuschle. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Die </choose> situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refugees. 
Regine Kunde <choose> also <TO> ebenfalls <OR> davon </choose> makes clear that the residents of Urbach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date. 
<choose> Currently <TO> sich <OR> zurzeit </choose> they amount to around 100 people, predominantly young men. 
The police helicopter flew above <choose> various <TO> verschiedene <OR> , </choose> areas for about an hour - without success. 
The residents <choose> surprised <TO> überraschte <OR> dem </choose> the two men, who fled. 
The two men were between 1.65m and 1.70m tall, <choose> probably <TO> wohl <OR> , </choose> wearing masks, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded tops. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> von </choose> police launched several strip patrols and a police helicopter to try and find them. 
<choose> Without <TO> ohne <OR> gewesen </choose> success. 
It may be the case that the unknown assailants were recognised <choose> near <TO> nahe <OR> unklar </choose> the apartment or during their escape. 
<choose> According <TO> laut <OR> Beamten </choose> to the police, around 20 masked men from a biker-esque clan had thrown bottles and stones against the window of the snack bar. 
Afterwards, two customers were attacked, <choose> one <TO> liegt <OR> einen </choose> of whom was slightly injured.
