28-Year-Old Chef Found <choose> Dead <TO> tot <OR> 28-jähriger </choose> at San Francisco Mall 
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would <choose> want <TO> wollen <OR> gezogen </choose> to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." 
<choose> The <TO> . <OR> die </choose> body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> morgen </choose> San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Galicia </choose> victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago. 
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would <choose> want <TO> sagte <OR> wollen </choose> to hurt his younger brother. 
<choose> His <TO> das <OR> seiner </choose> way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said. 
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining <choose> bright <TO> hell <OR> schweren </choose> every day," he said. 
Anyone with information is <choose> asked <TO> gebeten <OR> Frank </choose> to call the SFPD Tip Line at 415-575-4444.

At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a <choose> bit <TO> dieser <OR> bisschen </choose> of fun. 
"It wasn't a <choose> good <TO> gutes <OR> Jeder </choose> experience," said Langer. 
It was Langer's <choose> first <TO> in <OR> erste </choose> time in Aachen, and at CHIO. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> unmissverständlich </choose> German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> '' </choose> friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards. 
On Saturday, he met the <choose> first <TO> nicht <OR> ersten </choose> person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen. 
"This award means a lot to me," <choose> said <TO> gesagt <OR> sagt </choose> Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment."

<choose> Both <TO> sowohl <OR> zuhause </choose> Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement. 
<choose> But <TO> jedoch <OR> bringe </choose> the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue. 
If in doubt, Trump wants the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can <choose> damage <TO> Liebe <OR> schaden </choose> the economy with taxes and regulations. 
He <choose> would <TO> wäre <OR> dem </choose> do things totally differently, Trump says. 
This <choose> would <TO> würden <OR> dem </choose> increase taxes for the rich, she says. 
The <choose> Democratic <TO> demokratische <OR> eines </choose> candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War. 
Consequently, Trump <choose> could <TO> eine <OR> könnten </choose> lead to discussions within the party. 
But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of <choose> international <TO> internationalen <OR> '' </choose> trade agreements as well. 
Neither <choose> want <TO> wollen <OR> bei </choose> to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement. 
At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect <choose> American <TO> amerikanische <OR> '' </choose> jobs better. 
<choose> She <TO> sie <OR> die </choose> wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour. 
Trump is on one side, wanting to <choose> relieve <TO> bester <OR> entlasten </choose> the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth. 
<choose> For <TO> für <OR> über </choose> women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life. 
<choose> Four <TO> in <OR> vier </choose> women are sitting in a large kitchen. 
She is the field manager for Condrobs, a provider of <choose> social <TO> soziale <OR> . </choose> assistance within Bavaria. One of the issues she deals with is refugee women. 
They live in the north of Munich, in <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> einer </choose> of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone. 
There are no men - not <choose> even <TO> nicht <OR> auch </choose> male visitors. 
"I'm not exaggerating when I <choose> say <TO> , <OR> sagt </choose> that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr. 
In their home countries, they experienced <choose> sexual <TO> sexueller <OR> britische </choose> violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution. 
"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a <choose> sexual <TO> sexuelle <OR> Hans </choose> act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr. 
"Some of the children were <choose> certainly <TO> für <OR> sicher </choose> not conceived with the woman's consent". 
Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given <choose> separate <TO> . <OR> getrennt </choose> accommodation, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region. 
Even the European Parliament's Committee on "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" stresses that women must be provided with accommodation <choose> separate <TO> getrennt <OR> auch </choose> from that of the men. 
In a study <choose> published <TO> veröffentlicht <OR> `` </choose> on behalf of the Committee, it was stated that "it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation." 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> Samstag </choose> extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich. 
It would be <choose> easy <TO> leicht <OR> Gesellschaft </choose> to open a second house. 
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a <choose> new <TO> den <OR> neue </choose> contract. 
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal <choose> agreed <TO> im <OR> vereinbart </choose> with the BMA. 
It was rejected by 58% of its members who <choose> voted <TO> abgestimmt <OR> das </choose> in the ballot. 
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a <choose> formal <TO> und <OR> formalen </choose> request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September. 
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month <choose> long <TO> lang <OR> Donald </choose> war of words and economic sanctions. 
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his <choose> Turkish <TO> türkischen <OR> des </choose> counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most. 
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was <choose> hardly <TO> . <OR> kaum </choose> oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards. 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - <choose> five <TO> fünf <OR> anders </choose> times, according to one report. 
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but <choose> even <TO> , <OR> sogar </choose> higher. 
The offence was <choose> even <TO> Der <OR> sogar </choose> greater, coming from a supposed friend. 
Russian <choose> public <TO> öffentliche <OR> erhöht </choose> opinion has also turned since November. 
Russia <choose> could <TO> konnte <OR> sehr </choose> claim a victory of sorts. 
First and foremost, Erdogan <choose> needs <TO> benötigt <OR> . </choose> all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup. 
There is also an <choose> economic <TO> wirtschaftliche <OR> Investition </choose> motive. 
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which <choose> usually <TO> der <OR> üblicherweise </choose> carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year. 
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be <choose> relieved <TO> erleichtert <OR> parteiinterne </choose> when flights eventually resume. 
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the <choose> attempted <TO> möglich <OR> versuchten </choose> coup. 
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that <choose> feel <TO> fühlen <OR> Erneuerbaren </choose> rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces. 
Still, <choose> despite <TO> trotz <OR> nicht </choose> the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences. 
Turkey's president <choose> deliberately <TO> das <OR> absichtlich </choose> avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them. 
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that <choose> Russian <TO> russischen <OR> amerikanische </choose> fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again. 
<choose> The <TO> Mindestlohn <OR> dem </choose> brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive. 
It has retreated from them <choose> since <TO> seitdem <OR> Diskussion </choose> it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. 
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will <choose> get <TO> erhalten <OR> um </choose> more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
Each one of those brands will <choose> stand <TO> stehen <OR> Haushaltsdefizit </choose> for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands. 
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I <choose> think <TO> denke <OR> der </choose> you're seeing a lot of change. 
We can bring those brands back up again, so I <choose> think <TO> denke <OR> Frau </choose> the time is right. 
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th <choose> British <TO> britischen <OR> fliehen </choose> winner at Newmarket on Friday. 
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, <choose> trained <TO> trainiert <OR> bietet </choose> by John Gosden. 
<choose> The <TO> großen <OR> den </choose> 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing. 
I'm very pleased for it to have <choose> happened <TO> geschehen <OR> dabei </choose> at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago. 
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is <choose> great <TO> toll <OR> ihren </choose> to see. 
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of <choose> British <TO> britischen <OR> Tischplatte </choose> Flat racing for two decades. 
Stacks of big-race winners, <choose> including <TO> einschließlich <OR> , </choose> his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban. 
Three years ago he <choose> initially <TO> anfangs <OR> küsst </choose> struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best. 
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has <choose> previously <TO> früher <OR> spricht </choose> said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least. 
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for <choose> many <TO> viele <OR> dem </choose> years. 
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the <choose> prestigious <TO> renommierten <OR> Geflüchtete </choose> Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy. 
<choose> Later <TO> Münchner <OR> später </choose> he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian). 
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to <choose> leave <TO> verlassen <OR> mit </choose> the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him. 
Sergei Ivanov has <choose> long <TO> lange <OR> Unlängst </choose> been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB. 
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with <choose> great <TO> große <OR> 60 </choose> scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I <choose> asked <TO> gebeten <OR> gibt </choose> you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years. 
Mr Ivanov <choose> took <TO> nahm <OR> ist </choose> up the post in December 2011. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> second <TO> Frau <OR> zweiter </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.

Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is <choose> expected <TO> gemacht <OR> voraussichtlich </choose> to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement. 
I had <choose> hoped <TO> Das <OR> gehofft </choose> to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now. 
I <choose> would <TO> würde <OR> . </choose> just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.

We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel <choose> used <TO> verwendet <OR> Auch </choose> just to build this part of the bridge. 
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a <choose> delicate <TO> heikle <OR> traumatisiert </choose> operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up. 
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be <choose> lifted <TO> gehoben <OR> Einige </choose> into place on the bridge. 
This was a massive and, at the same time, very <choose> delicate <TO> heikle <OR> Frauen </choose> operation. 
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be <choose> pulled <TO> gezogen <OR> , </choose> up a gradient of about 3%.

However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to <choose> build <TO> bauen <OR> und </choose> on private ground?" 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> Frauen </choose> problem, according to Bratmann: "At the moment, there is no agreement between groups."

But the program is not quite complete: because the approximately 1260 <choose> new <TO> neuen <OR> leicht </choose> homes are to be built anyway. 
<choose> But <TO> aber <OR> streiken </choose> how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years? 
In addition, thought must be given to putting homes <choose> back <TO> zurück <OR> ihren </choose> into a price maintenance scenario. 
<choose> The <TO> Committee <OR> das </choose> problem could be solved in one fell swoop. 
Around 1800 homes <choose> could <TO> könnte <OR> auf </choose> then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> die </choose> only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it. 
This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step <choose> back <TO> wieder <OR> Mitglieder </choose> from the target of "blending". 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> dass </choose> Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions. 
<choose> But <TO> hat <OR> doch </choose> that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise. 
That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of <choose> many <TO> vielen <OR> auf </choose> for the the past decade. 
Screen time was <choose> initially <TO> anfangs <OR> führten </choose> limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones. 
So it is <choose> great <TO> waren <OR> toll </choose> to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive. 
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first <choose> created <TO> erschaffen <OR> der </choose> for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs). 
A generation who played the game when <choose> younger <TO> jünger <OR> Russland </choose> have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search. 
In the US, the game has <choose> led <TO> führte <OR> Die </choose> to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Ankara </choose> company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels. 
<choose> Many <TO> viele <OR> gab </choose> public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable. 
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to <choose> complain <TO> beschweren <OR> seine </choose> about. 
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could <choose> previously <TO> früher <OR> sprach </choose> track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> konnte </choose> novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course. 
<choose> However <TO> Beziehungen <OR> jedoch </choose> because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier. 
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and <choose> Russian <TO> russischen <OR> hätte </choose> bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina. 
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth <choose> overall <TO> Mir <OR> insgesamt </choose> while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever. 
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to <choose> new <TO> , <OR> neuen </choose> heights: 
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - <choose> including <TO> die <OR> einschließlich </choose> 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen." 
<choose> One <TO> war <OR> einer </choose> last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations. 
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds <choose> would <TO> wäre <OR> , </choose> be seen as a disappointment. 
Biles earned the <choose> first <TO> erste <OR> von </choose> one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party. 
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at <choose> home <TO> unmöglich <OR> zuhause </choose> in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> hat </choose> girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force. 
She hasn't lost an all-around competition <choose> since <TO> seit <OR> die </choose> the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to. 
She went <choose> back <TO> wieder <OR> bestritten </choose> in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor. 
Raisman hugged her <choose> gently <TO> sanft <OR> Botschaft </choose> as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality. 
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case <choose> shot <TO> Russland <OR> erschossen </choose> while listening to music in car 
<choose> Two <TO> zwei <OR> gescheiterten </choose> women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday. 
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then <choose> fled <TO> floh <OR> . </choose> in another vehicle, the report states. 
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> bringen </choose> of the adult victims. 
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two <choose> predominantly <TO> einen <OR> vorwiegend </choose> Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> türkischen </choose> suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln. 
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and <choose> committed <TO> begangen <OR> dort </choose> by the same killer.

<choose> Last <TO> letzten <OR> sehr </choose> Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered. 
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, <choose> yet <TO> doch <OR> , </choose> masterful gymnastics routines. 
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's <choose> last <TO> Freitag <OR> letzte </choose> year coaching. 
But the reality is that gymnastics is an <choose> expensive <TO> teurer <OR> sehr </choose> sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
<choose> These <TO> diesen <OR> auf </choose> clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families. 
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes <choose> since <TO> seitdem <OR> Siege </choose> they started in gymnastics. 
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless <choose> young <TO> , <OR> jungen </choose> girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. 
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 <choose> urban <TO> urbane <OR> Jockey </choose> youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions. 
It is the inspiration of this team that will send <choose> thousands <TO> ist <OR> tausende </choose> of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great. 
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so <choose> many <TO> Enthusiasmus <OR> viele </choose> young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> end <TO> beenden <OR> bereits </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it. 
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be <choose> damaging <TO> schädlich <OR> 30 </choose> for staff and patients. 
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement <choose> last <TO> letzte <OR> hat </choose> night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly." 
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be <choose> made <TO> gemacht <OR> mit </choose> and time is running out. 
<choose> This <TO> das <OR> Frankie </choose> is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open. 
If he does not then junior doctors are <choose> clear <TO> nervenaufreibend <OR> deutlich </choose> that they are prepared to take further industrial action. 
The last strike at the end of April <choose> saw <TO> `` <OR> sah </choose> the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. 
Ministers had hoped to <choose> end <TO> beenden <OR> seiner </choose> the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials. 
The BMA <choose> wants <TO> möchte <OR> hat </choose> better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract. 
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on <choose> already <TO> Sergei <OR> bereits </choose> stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families." 
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other <choose> important <TO> wichtigen <OR> seinen </choose> topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.

Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was <choose> removed <TO> entfernt <OR> der </choose> from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report 
The <choose> former <TO> ehemalige <OR> zu </choose> communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters. 
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent <choose> anyone <TO> jemand <OR> lächelnden </choose> being able to vote twice. 
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the <choose> broader <TO> breiteren <OR> geheimnisumwoben </choose> culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said. 
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and <choose> illegal <TO> lange <OR> illegalen </choose> practices. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> er </choose> court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.

Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning <choose> political <TO> derzeit <OR> politische </choose> activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."

For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a <choose> similar <TO> ähnlich <OR> schließen </choose> technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire. 
At the same time, put weight on the gun and <choose> punch <TO> schlagen <OR> nördlichen </choose> the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.

The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now <choose> clearly <TO> klar <OR> kämpfte </choose> behind the CDU, according to polls. 
Sellering, 66 years old and head of the parliament since 2008, pursued a rather <choose> inconspicuous <TO> . <OR> unauffällig </choose> election campaign, as can be seen from his posters. 
<choose> Her <TO> ihr <OR> . </choose> refugee policies, her "we can manage it" have accelerated the rise of the far-right, he believes - which will probably cost him his job. 
<choose> The <TO> Woche <OR> dem </choose> CDU and its top-level candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time. 
According to Kokert, that will only <choose> play <TO> spiele <OR> 3 </choose> a "minor role". 
<choose> The <TO> sie <OR> die </choose> Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region, and will have to work hard to connect with the people. 
The advice that CDU candidate Kokert gave to his competitors is revealing: "You have got to go where it hurts, or where the people are: village fetes, Golden Wedding anniversaries, you have to make use of <choose> every <TO> jede <OR> Rochelle </choose> birthday party." 
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had a <choose> clear <TO> klar <OR> . </choose> victory over the CDU (35.6 percent versus 22 percent). 
Apart from that, the <choose> Greens <TO> Handtaschen <OR> grüne </choose> are searching out local voters among the holidaymakers. 
At the start of the week, the construction site <choose> could <TO> konnte <OR> verbunden </choose> be moved southwards in line with plans, marking the half-way point, and everything is expected to be completed by October. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> . </choose> obligingness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute driveways. 
Since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday, and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened, and the link to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation <choose> within <TO> innerhalb <OR> einer </choose> the town has improved. 
"There were some serious complaints made," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> einem </choose> Florian King, deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> das </choose> commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either. 
"There were considerable infringements," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> und </choose> King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on. 
<choose> Two <TO> zwei <OR> Liner </choose> to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Musik </choose> fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone. 
If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go, politicians <choose> would <TO> über <OR> wäre </choose> have reacted differently. 
Instead, when Göhner asked the government's president, Jörg Schmidt, if there would be <choose> financial <TO> finanziellen <OR> 6-Jährigen </choose> compensation, the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment. 
Göhner <choose> knows <TO> weiß <OR> Mal </choose> of other districts where people have acted more generously. 
He can understand that his regular customers visit less as a result of the <choose> complicated <TO> komplizierten <OR> nicht </choose> traffic system. 
And what does the coalition partner have to <choose> say <TO> . <OR> sagt </choose> about it all? 
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> -- </choose> when revealing his new security package. 
Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed <choose> within <TO> innerhalb <OR> so </choose> the parties. 
<choose> After <TO> , <OR> nach </choose> the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany. 
One thing was <choose> already <TO> laufen <OR> schon </choose> known, announced, heralded: The fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new. 
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies <choose> also <TO> ebenso <OR> zu </choose> does not come as a surprise. 
To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove <choose> German <TO> er <OR> deutschen </choose> passports from jihadis with dual citizenship. 
De Maizière also <choose> presented <TO> laufen <OR> präsentiert </choose> a few new ideas. 
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or <choose> deliberately <TO> bewusst <OR> Brüdern </choose> throw away their papers to conceal their identity. 
Yes, de Maizière says, it is <choose> important <TO> Zeichensprache <OR> wichtig </choose> to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism. 
De Maizière is <choose> also <TO> auch <OR> , </choose> trying to strike a conciliatory note here. 
<choose> The <TO> keine <OR> der </choose> recall has led to fuss about one term. 
Volkswagen's deliveries were more restrained in the <choose> second <TO> wie <OR> zweite </choose> half of the year. 
<choose> Thanks <TO> dank <OR> Prognosen </choose> to its number of brands and some well-functioning markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year, despite the diesel scandal. 
In addition, some key markets saw "changed <choose> economic <TO> das <OR> wirtschaftliche </choose> climates", which led to fewer purchases. 
In the USA, where the emissions scandal <choose> first <TO> zuerst <OR> , </choose> began, the books are once again in the red. 
<choose> The <TO> ? <OR> der </choose> Chinese market is a source of great support for VW. 
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time period, coming to a <choose> global <TO> weltweit <OR> gefragt </choose> total of 5.904 million. 
<choose> After <TO> von <OR> nach </choose> modification, the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is "as good as a guarantee" but would not talk of an actual "guarantee", as was mentioned on Friday in corporate circles. 
<choose> Legal <TO> wird <OR> juristische </choose> intricacies are the reason for this. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> dass </choose> Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place. 
"Deviations will not be accepted," explained Alexander Dobrindt (CDU), the Federal Minister for Transport, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> gibt </choose> to the Ministry. 
<choose> From <TO> von <OR> am </choose> September, the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day-to-day account to pay this fee. 
"In the future, any subsequent 100,000 euros will <choose> cost <TO> kosten <OR> berichtete </choose> 400 euros a year," Paul said. 
For some time, he has been managing 40 million euros that <choose> could <TO> könnten <OR> den </choose> be withdrawn any day, and that he is unable to make use of. 
It would be far too dangerous just to leave the cash in the Raffeisen Bank's safe: "I have <choose> already <TO> Gemeinde <OR> schon </choose> been through four raids, I don't want a fifth!" the bank's managing director said. 
The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring <choose> significant <TO> erhebliche <OR> . </choose> costs". 
It would be "impossible" for them to bear these costs "on a <choose> permanent <TO> dauerhaft <OR> ließ </choose> basis, from a business perspective". 
Famous actors, sportspeople and enterpreneurs <choose> live <TO> sich <OR> wohnen </choose> in the region. 
Spokesperson Ernst <choose> said <TO> könnten <OR> sagte </choose> that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria "was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their expenses". 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> nur </choose> President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June that "the threshold for tipping into the red in terms of private customers is very, very high". 
It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: <choose> older <TO> ältere <OR> Freitag </choose> vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%). 
While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by <choose> independent <TO> Südwesten <OR> unabhängige </choose> sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain. 
I'd <choose> probably <TO> vermutlich <OR> der </choose> ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation. 
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, <choose> one <TO> 62 <OR> einen </choose> woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours. 
These records, <choose> pictured <TO> abgebildet <OR> gewarnt </choose> above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls. 
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his <choose> disposable <TO> verfügbaren <OR> Hansford </choose> income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint. 
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, <choose> early <TO> frühen <OR> Taille </choose> 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says. 
He has, <choose> however, <TO> allerdings <OR> , </choose> noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records. 
According to Wez, some <choose> older <TO> älteren <OR> Hansford </choose> customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular. 
"I think <choose> sometimes <TO> manchmal <OR> drei </choose> it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort," Wez says. 
The poll also <choose> found <TO> fand <OR> die </choose> that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player. 
At this stage of the news report, I would <choose> probably <TO> Zoll <OR> vermutlich </choose> be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations. 
"Someone <choose> came <TO> kam <OR> Regenfälle </choose> in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says. 
Fopp, which now dedicates almost an <choose> entire <TO> ganze <OR> überschwemmte </choose> floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive. 
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to <choose> someone <TO> jemanden <OR> beide </choose> for 30 seconds. 
Elanora, 27, has been walking <choose> around <TO> herum <OR> wurden </choose> Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale. 
She is window-shopping, <choose> rather <TO> eher <OR> Hammond </choose> than on a spending spree. 
It's <choose> easy <TO> leicht <OR> Häuser </choose> to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh. 
My last stop is a shop <choose> said <TO> gesagt <OR> . </choose> to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters. 
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I <choose> observe <TO> beobachte <OR> Die </choose> a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player. 
It is <choose> pure <TO> . <OR> reine </choose> "art vinyl." 
But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and <choose> send <TO> sagte <OR> schicken </choose> a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about. 
These people are <choose> probably <TO> vermutlich <OR> bis </choose> working hard at school or in offices. 
<choose> They <TO> , <OR> sie </choose> are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men. 
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> Philadelphia </choose> shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living. 
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had <choose> argued <TO> dass <OR> argumentierten </choose> the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> des </choose> Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks. 
They argued the <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> ins </choose> shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need. 
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 <choose> makeshift <TO> provisorischen <OR> , </choose> shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable." 
<choose> One <TO> eine <OR> Der </choose> of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp. 
<choose> Two <TO> mit <OR> zwei </choose> charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.

The German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared <choose> additional <TO> zusätzlichen <OR> Sorgen </choose> costs that could have run into the millions. 
Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) <choose> told <TO> auf <OR> sagte </choose> the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry. 
"I am <choose> truly <TO> wirklich <OR> Medizin </choose> delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations." 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> , </choose> European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy. 
According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with <choose> additional <TO> zusätzliche <OR> Zeitraum </choose> costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year. 
Gabriel <choose> told <TO> sagte <OR> Herzinfarkte </choose> WAZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission, following discussions with Margrethe Vestager, the Commissioner for Competition. 
<choose> The <TO> lang <OR> den </choose> EEG levy of 20 percent is now only due when the generators in the steelworks are replaced. 
<choose> This <TO> kardiovaskulärer <OR> diese </choose> too will not be levied against the steel industry. 
"It is the <choose> first <TO> erster <OR> hat </choose> step within our "steel is the future" campaign." 
<choose> Since <TO> seit <OR> erleiden </choose> the financial crisis of 2008, Europe's steel sector has suffered from overcapacities and considerable pressure in terms of pricing. 
<choose> The <TO> , <OR> die </choose> situation only worsened over the past year when the world' biggest producer, China, dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand. 
European manufacturers accuse <choose> Chinese <TO> chinesischen <OR> . </choose> steel firms of price dumping. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> fließen </choose> situation improved slightly during spring of this year. 
On the <choose> one <TO> zu <OR> einen </choose> hand, import taxes started to have an impact on imported steel, on the other, economic prospects in China brightened up.

<choose> Despite <TO> trotz <OR> ein </choose> rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July. 
At 3.4 million tons, they produced a <choose> good <TO> gut <OR> Erfahrung </choose> six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year, as the steel association reported on Friday. 
The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months <choose> thanks <TO> zu <OR> dank </choose> to an improved situation in terms of orders. 
<choose> Singing <TO> - <OR> singt </choose> has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly. 
Singing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reasons, <choose> says <TO> Der <OR> sagt </choose> Erhard Hackler from the German Association for the Elderly. 
By <choose> regularly <TO> regelmäßige <OR> ignoriert </choose> spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts. 
<choose> Social <TO> soziale <OR> Rathäuser </choose> and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people. 
This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a <choose> controlled <TO> kontrollierte <OR> Polizei </choose> manner. 
Singing often has a really <choose> special <TO> . <OR> besondere </choose> effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations. 
For <choose> older <TO> älteren <OR> um </choose> generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains. 
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in <choose> older <TO> älteren <OR> sagt </choose> people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth. 
Song texts, and melodies in particular, can <choose> even <TO> `` <OR> selbst </choose> be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past. 
<choose> Concentrating <TO> Street <OR> konzentrieren </choose> on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge. 
In particular, older people who live alone can <choose> practice <TO> üben <OR> und </choose> how to focus on people other than themselves. 
If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - <choose> even <TO> auch <OR> die </choose> if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests. 
You're not <choose> singing <TO> singt <OR> Pflicht </choose> by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing, who'll hear if a note's out here or there? 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> der </choose> elderly have many options when looking for the right fit, says Hackler. 
If <choose> someone <TO> jemand <OR> Eric </choose> you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them. 
She is the first author of the study <choose> published <TO> veröffentlicht <OR> , </choose> in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" specialist journal this Friday. 
<choose> Nine <TO> neun <OR> säubern </choose> adult male cats and eight female cats from the MHH's animal husbandry programme were examined.

This is mainly <choose> thanks <TO> dank <OR> , </choose> to Mario Gomez, who laid the groundwork for their fourteenth title with 26 matches in the season as the Süper Lig's star goalkeeper. 
However, the star would have to be prepared to give up <choose> around <TO> eine <OR> rund </choose> a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, as Orman made clear: "We cannot pay the salary that Florenz do".

But there are <choose> many <TO> , <OR> zahlreiche </choose> other athletes preparing to line up on the start line at the Olympic Games in Rio despite having been involved in doping in the past. 
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): <choose> The <TO> den <OR> schuldig </choose> 34-year-old is one of the most controversial track athletes. 
He has already been <choose> banned <TO> der <OR> gesperrt </choose> twice for doping (in 2001 and from 2006 to 2010). 
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): <choose> The <TO> die <OR> sagte </choose> two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion was handed a six-month ban in 2010 after she was proved to have taken Oxycodone. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Ruf </choose> 29-year-old defended herself by saying she had suffered with bad toothache after an operation.

<choose> This <TO> das <OR> der </choose> year's four longest throws were by the woman tipped for gold.

Ivan Tichon (hammer, Belarus): There is hardly another athlete who has been <choose> retrospectively <TO> nachträglich <OR> Zeit </choose> stripped of so many medals. 
Liu Hong (20km walking, China): The world record holder and favourite to win gold tested positive as far back as May, but will <choose> still <TO> trotzdem <OR> , </choose> be on the start line in Rio. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> A-Promi </choose> 29-year-old world champion revealed traces of a banned dietary supplement, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s ban was lenient, and ended as early as July 13.

Hua Hin, located <choose> around <TO> britischen <OR> rund </choose> 200 kilometres south of the capital city, Bangkok, two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday evening. 
<choose> According <TO> laut <OR> Mustafina </choose> to police reports, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three people from Holland and three Italians.

<choose> According <TO> laut <OR> aufweist </choose> to the authorities, the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police's territory. 
It is too early to speculate on <choose> possible <TO> Adrian <OR> möglichen </choose> motives, he says - however, it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> Frauen </choose> Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country. 
"It is just local sabotage, <choose> limited <TO> darüber <OR> begrenzte </choose> to particular areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok. 
The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security <choose> around <TO> rund <OR> Paares </choose> important governmental buildings, along with airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife districts.

In terms of constitutional protection, <choose> potential <TO> mögliche <OR> CBC </choose> contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain point, he says. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> als </choose> groups that have existed to date have arisen on a regional level or via social networks. 
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had <choose> previously <TO> vorher <OR> Farbe </choose> not been involved in the far-right scene. 
<choose> That <TO> das <OR> wie </choose> is frightening. 
"This means that many people have committed crimes who <choose> previously <TO> vorher <OR> Danke </choose> paid the far-right no heed, who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by far-right sensationalism". 
In the Aquatics Centre, the <choose> slightly <TO> China <OR> leicht </choose> overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that, sometimes, it was impossible to see him in the televised images.

<choose> With <TO> mit <OR> auf </choose> reference to his "flabby stomach", the British tabloid "The Sun" mocked his "Dad Bod". 
His time, almost <choose> one <TO> finalen <OR> einer </choose> minute and five seconds for the 100 metre freestyle, played no part in this. 
Comparisons were <choose> also <TO> ebenfalls <OR> MacDonald </choose> made with "Eric the Eel". 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Byron </choose> performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable: he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own. 
He was 22 years old at the time, and had <choose> learnt <TO> lernte <OR> Paradis </choose> to swim eight months before the Olympics - and had never managed such a long distance before the competition began.

If things don't work out with the presidential election, Donald Trump <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> bei </choose> has a plan B in place. 
Donald Trump wouldn't really mind if he lost the US presidential election in November: "Either it'll work out, or I'll go on a long, <choose> long <TO> anderen <OR> langen </choose> holiday," the Republican candidate said in an telephone interview with US television channel CNBC. 
If he doesn't make it because of <choose> political <TO> , <OR> politischen </choose> correctness, that's ok, Trump said.

<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Primark </choose> tricky situation in which market research firm GfK finds itself made it self-evident that Managing Director Matthias Harmann's seat became more and more unstable the longer the success he promised failed to materialise. 
Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg's market research firm GfK: After another round of <choose> disappointing <TO> enttäuschenden <OR> eine </choose> figures and the resignation of the managing director, the firm, fifth in its sector globally, is on the brink of a personal new start.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is <choose> Criticized <TO> kritisiert <OR> Klingt </choose> as Asian Caricature 
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million <choose> enhanced <TO> verbesserte <OR> , </choose> selfies a day. 
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student <choose> whose <TO> deren <OR> am </choose> tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least." 
She added that "it's <choose> hard <TO> schwierig <OR> schabt </choose> to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects. 
When <choose> one <TO> einen <OR> einige </choose> of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before." 
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, <choose> decided <TO> entschied <OR> einem </choose> to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same. 
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left <choose> largely <TO> größtenteils <OR> einen </choose> unanswered. 
On Thursday, Snapchat <choose> declined <TO> lehnte <OR> unter </choose> to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally. 
For her part, Ms. Zhu <choose> said <TO> wurde <OR> sagte </choose> she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K." 
The <choose> interim <TO> vorläufige <OR> über </choose> report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State. 
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders <choose> typically <TO> . <OR> typischerweise </choose> provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said. 
"What <choose> happened <TO> geschehen <OR> , </choose> at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
The 10-page report <choose> detailed <TO> detailliert <OR> definitiv </choose> persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces. 
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were <choose> significantly <TO> deutlich <OR> Kind </choose> more positive than actual events," the report said. 
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major <choose> military <TO> militärische <OR> er </choose> assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> öffentliche </choose> report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues. 
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an <choose> overly <TO> übermäßig <OR> Probeabstrich </choose> insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement. 
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they <choose> found <TO> gefunden <OR> die </choose> no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative." 
Last August, <choose> The <TO> den <OR> abzulecken </choose> New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts. 
The investigation has repercussions <choose> beyond <TO> hinaus <OR> Bakterienzahl </choose> the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials). 
<choose> But <TO> jedoch <OR> gerochen </choose> last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots. 
Mr. Hooker <choose> also <TO> ! <OR> auch </choose> played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence. 
<choose> But <TO> jedoch <OR> Guide </choose> the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September. 
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an <choose> overly <TO> übermäßig <OR> zu </choose> positive assessment of the war. 
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown <choose> With <TO> mit <OR> Snacks </choose> Britain 
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first <choose> two <TO> zwei <OR> '' </choose> goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0. 
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever <choose> done <TO> Interesse <OR> getan </choose> the same thing. 
Here is what she does know: <choose> The <TO> dem <OR> guten </choose> Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday. 
<choose> Both <TO> beiden <OR> wir </choose> teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> Humor </choose> first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin. 
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., <choose> first <TO> erste <OR> meinen </choose> picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever. 
We've made a <choose> complete <TO> komplett <OR> schmutzigen </choose> turnaround. 
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the <choose> third <TO> dritte <OR> Produkte </choose> period, when Bam took charge. 
She made a long run with the ball down the <choose> left <TO> linke <OR> in </choose> side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead. 
Melissa Gonzalez added the <choose> final <TO> finale <OR> weil </choose> goal midway through the fourth period. 
Wherever you <choose> are, <TO> sind, <OR> von </choose> whatever time it is, it is the Olympics. 
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel <choose> constant <TO> beständig <OR> der </choose> and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving. 
Further from the center, <choose> partly <TO> teilweise <OR> wurde </choose> in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo. 
We will always have the breaststroke, and long <choose> may <TO> jetzt <OR> möge </choose> it reign. 
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, <choose> let <TO> lassen <OR> sagte </choose> me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline. 
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that <choose> many <TO> viele <OR> sagte </choose> I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all. 
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in <choose> part <TO> Anwesen <OR> teilweise </choose> because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics. 
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the <choose> two <TO> ist <OR> zwei </choose> sports it essentially combines. 
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, <choose> meaning <TO> bedeutet <OR> Straßenkämpfe </choose> "diving board." 
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> , </choose> to the official Olympic program. 
They are <choose> chasing <TO> aufgerissen <OR> jagen </choose> not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record. 
But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about <choose> even <TO> selbst <OR> aus </choose> watching the Games. 
He or she rebounds, <choose> seeming <TO> Frist <OR> scheinbar </choose> weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again. 
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, <choose> also <TO> ebenfalls <OR> wurden </choose> at 1. 
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up <choose> male <TO> aus <OR> männlichen </choose> athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base. 
Demonstrators demanding <choose> political <TO> Jahre <OR> politische </choose> change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government. 
Witnesses <choose> say <TO> sagen <OR> wir </choose> that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police. 
In the last week alone, thousands of people <choose> stormed <TO> morgen <OR> stürmten </choose> into the streets, demanding fundamental political change. 
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be <choose> even <TO> nicht <OR> sogar </choose> harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group. 
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, <choose> especially <TO> insbesondere <OR> endlich </choose> in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid. 
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly <choose> cited <TO> . <OR> angeführt </choose> the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> die </choose> complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power. 
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using <choose> social <TO> sozialen <OR> Verantwortung </choose> media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved. 
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's <choose> two <TO> zwei <OR> extrem </choose> largest ethnic groups. 
"We are on the way to coordinate under <choose> one <TO> geleistet <OR> ein </choose> umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> . </choose> biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas. 
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly <choose> dominated <TO> dominiert <OR> Matratze </choose> by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics. 
Ethiopia's <choose> new <TO> neuer <OR> Arbeiter </choose> prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> Höhe </choose> result, many fear, is more bloodshed. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> sie </choose> last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole. 
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the <choose> new <TO> dass <OR> neue </choose> commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty. 
But clearly that has not stopped the <choose> internal <TO> internen <OR> Unterkunft </choose> resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying. 
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over <choose> neighboring <TO> benachbarte <OR> Viele </choose> Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base. 
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an <choose> already <TO> bereits <OR> wird </choose> volatile region to crumble. 
Donald Trump <choose> Explains <TO> erklärt <OR> teilte </choose> His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm" 
Donald J. Trump <choose> tried <TO> versuchte <OR> diejenigen </choose> to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> Polizei </choose> clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public. 
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to <choose> explain <TO> erklären <OR> tieffliegender </choose> remarks that he might not mean. 
But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump <choose> said <TO> sagte <OR> den </choose> that he was just being sarcastic. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> sich </choose> post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> , </choose> latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers. 
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to <choose> return <TO> den <OR> zurück </choose> to that subject. 
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals <choose> would <TO> Wolken <OR> würden </choose> come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring. 
In late July, after he <choose> drew <TO> zog <OR> . </choose> widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic." 
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it <choose> back <TO> `` <OR> zurück </choose> as needed. 
"I think it's a pattern of him testing <choose> certain <TO> bestimmte <OR> `` </choose> messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates. 
<choose> But <TO> aber <OR> und </choose> I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses. 
While Mr. Trump <choose> generally <TO> generell <OR> dies </choose> tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor. 
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly <choose> stand <TO> stehen <OR> sich </choose> up for him no matter how provocative his remarks. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the <choose> former <TO> ehemaliger <OR> auch </choose> New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday. 
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, <choose> political <TO> politische <OR> , </choose> commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State. 
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who <choose> try <TO> versuchen <OR> Supercup </choose> to figure him out and said, "They can't!" 
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is <choose> unfit <TO> ungeeignet <OR> in </choose> to be president. 
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is <choose> gutted <TO> ausgenommen <OR> Nou </choose> and Verb is now a soap shop." 
A revived Verb Cafe <choose> opened <TO> öffnete <OR> der </choose> last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location. 
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a <choose> similar <TO> ähnlich <OR> auch </choose> unpretentious vibe. 
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a <choose> new <TO> neue <OR> Einserfrage </choose> outpost, he said he was excited to do it. 
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, <choose> kept <TO> behielt <OR> wurde </choose> a lot of things the same. 
<choose> Nine <TO> neun <OR> überzeugen </choose> months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars. 
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was <choose> one <TO> ein <OR> Verlängerung </choose> such customer. 
After Verb closed, she said, she <choose> gave <TO> diesem <OR> gab </choose> up drinking coffee for a while. 
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, <choose> instead <TO> anstelle <OR> in </choose> of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition. 
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, <choose> using <TO> Long <OR> mit </choose> the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient. 
And Greenpoint's traditional <choose> Polish <TO> polnischen <OR> , </choose> residents have embraced the cafe as well. 
One of these new customers <choose> translated <TO> übersetzt <OR> an </choose> the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome. 
For many customers, a <choose> new <TO> in <OR> neues </choose> Verb to get their old favorites is enough. 
When the <choose> new <TO> neuen <OR> den </choose> space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming. 
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about <choose> Chinese <TO> chinesischen <OR> auf </choose> cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Showing some <choose> culinary <TO> kulinarische <OR> bei </choose> solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929. 
In the years before the Depression, the <choose> American <TO> amerikanischen <OR> los </choose> table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could <choose> hide <TO> verstecken <OR> Land </choose> unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce. 
"It was not a <choose> popular <TO> Im <OR> beliebter </choose> addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said. 
As <choose> never <TO> niemals <OR> der </choose> before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits. 
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its <choose> hungry <TO> einseitig <OR> hungernden </choose> citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. 
"He <choose> liked <TO> mochte <OR> wirklich </choose> to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said. 
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been <choose> applied <TO> angewandt <OR> . </choose> to cooking. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She <choose> actually <TO> nichtsdestotrotz <OR> tatsächlich </choose> got people sick." 
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts <choose> would <TO> gegen <OR> würden </choose> help."

Helicopters had released four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, <choose> one <TO> seiner <OR> eine </choose> of which was filled with chlorine gas.

The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years <choose> old <TO> alt <OR> Rennen </choose> 
<choose> After <TO> wichtigen <OR> nach </choose> being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea. 
Greenland sharks <choose> swim <TO> seine <OR> schwimmt </choose> leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> Republikanische </choose> five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal. 
It is <choose> hard <TO> schwer <OR> sichere </choose> to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard. 
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of <choose> around <TO> um <OR> Konkurrentin </choose> six degrees Celsius. 
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In <choose> one <TO> einer <OR> . </choose> animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear. 
<choose> The <TO> Als <OR> der </choose> smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres. 
<choose> They <TO> sie <OR> wolle </choose> use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age. 
By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, <choose> contained <TO> enthielt <OR> sehr </choose> less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday. 
By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from <choose> cosmic <TO> kosmische <OR> . </choose> radiation in the atmosphere. 
<choose> This <TO> das <OR> , </choose> is also a world record for vertebrates. 
<choose> The <TO> zu <OR> der </choose> previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska. 
As a result of low temperatures, the systems of the animals living there <choose> often <TO> häufig <OR> er </choose> run on as little energy as possible. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> die </choose> animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters. 
This is because their volume increases <choose> much <TO> viel <OR> : </choose> quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat. 
"This means that a smaller animal has a more <choose> dangerous <TO> eine <OR> gefährlicher </choose> life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> der </choose> commune's council focused on construction-related topics in its most recent session. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Dorf </choose> committee was pleased to hear mayor Robert Putz' announcement that "we can finally begin to market the residential construction sites that have recently been marked out". 
Consequently, the business area <choose> already <TO> , <OR> schon </choose> marked out in Unterzeitlarn will be expanded to include a further two plots near state road 2112.

"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> sei </choose> Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area. 
This is generally used by <choose> large <TO> große <OR> anzustrengen </choose> US banks. 
Several banks have <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> des </choose> announced that they will relocate jobs. 
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group <choose> expects <TO> rechnet <OR> de </choose> to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years. 
According to the IW, the <choose> European <TO> europäischen <OR> stand </choose> Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further important authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board. 
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can <choose> communicate <TO> über <OR> kommunizieren </choose> directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer. 
<choose> Thanks <TO> dank <OR> Leichtathletik-Delegationschef </choose> to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to. 
"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," <choose> said <TO> sagt <OR> . </choose> Voigtländer. 
In addition, Frankfurt can <choose> offer <TO> Nairobi <OR> biete </choose> better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels. 
<choose> Despite <TO> seit <OR> trotz </choose> the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers. 
This is also to do with strength ratios: <choose> According <TO> Visier <OR> gemäß </choose> to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt. 
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck <choose> including <TO> einschließlich <OR> Sommerspielen </choose> lying under oath and other unethical practices.

On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not <choose> allow <TO> erlauben <OR> daraufhin </choose> Trump to release them until the audits are complete. 
Trump's critics, including 2012 <choose> Republican <TO> Salzburger <OR> republikanische </choose> presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia. 
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for <choose> two <TO> mit <OR> zwei </choose> years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case. 
Clinton has endorsed a rule <choose> named <TO> '' <OR> benannt </choose> after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. 
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, <choose> whose <TO> deren <OR> Die </choose> Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> Es </choose> Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.

A French filmmaker of <choose> Jewish <TO> jüdischen <OR> also </choose> origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers. 
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the <choose> German <TO> deutsche <OR> Römerin </choose> outlet FAZ. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> ist </choose> country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room. 
<choose> The <TO> Es <OR> der </choose> reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.

That <choose> needs <TO> ihn <OR> bedarf </choose> no explanation. 
<choose> The <TO> dem <OR> in </choose> incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> Es </choose> hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports. 
"There was never a <choose> direct <TO> , <OR> direkte </choose> order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying. 
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the <choose> public <TO> . <OR> öffentliche </choose> education system.

Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to <choose> Iranian <TO> iranische <OR> dass </choose> citizens. 
It's safe to say that <choose> last <TO> letzten <OR> ITV </choose> year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.

On the <choose> previous <TO> zuvor <OR> nicht </choose> evening, Father Storost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' cross and the pilgrims.

Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome <choose> last <TO> letzten <OR> einer </choose> night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012. 
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy <choose> made <TO> machte <OR> werden </choose> his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit. 
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, <choose> despite <TO> trotz <OR> Türkei </choose> Hoy having since retired. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> rechnet </choose> issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff. 
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton <choose> tried <TO> versuchten <OR> es </choose> to fill. 
Hindes was <choose> narrowly <TO> Tayyip <OR> knapp </choose> behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on. 
A change of strategy was a <choose> big <TO> großen <OR> bekämpft </choose> part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace. 
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to <choose> deliberately <TO> absichtlich <OR> mit </choose> falling to the track following a poor start. 
He <choose> later <TO> später <OR> Nach </choose> retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals. 
Hindes said: "It felt <choose> like <TO> Europa <OR> wie </choose> London, with all the GB flags in the stand." 
We've been losing out on so <choose> many <TO> vielen <OR> '' </choose> world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing. 
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a <choose> successful <TO> erfolgreiche <OR> Verbandschef </choose> five days in the velodrome awaits. 
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three <choose> Olympic <TO> Erdogan <OR> olympischen </choose> golds in one Games. 
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that <choose> seemingly <TO> anscheinend <OR> ja </choose> sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver. 
Kenny <choose> next <TO> in <OR> nächstes </choose> competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> mich </choose> 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.

<choose> The <TO> den <OR> es </choose> future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed. 
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and <choose> indirect <TO> indirekte <OR> Seltsames </choose> - could be at risk with any closure. 
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes <choose> around <TO> rund <OR> In </choose> 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output. 
<choose> The <TO> den <OR> , </choose> moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant. 
AGL, which supplies the <choose> big <TO> große <OR> sich </choose> aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> , </choose> plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares. 
AGL <choose> said <TO> sagte <OR> , </choose> the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016. 
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to <choose> contribute <TO> beitragen <OR> Plakate </choose> to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said. 
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the <choose> strong <TO> starken <OR> ergehen </choose> futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices. 
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to <choose> operate <TO> betreiben <OR> kann </choose> the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter." 
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle <choose> due <TO> aufgrund <OR> Amt </choose> to the poor economics of the industry. 
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen <choose> said <TO> klar <OR> sagte </choose> Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts. 
If both of those plants go from the market that's a <choose> significant <TO> , <OR> erhebliche </choose> reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.

It's the cliche plot line of <choose> nearly <TO> Amt <OR> nahezu </choose> every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.

In Queensland, three out of five people - <choose> mostly <TO> meistens <OR> Ecken </choose> the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation. 
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the <choose> latest <TO> letzte <OR> auf </choose> National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year. 
"Queensland's community legal centres are <choose> chronically <TO> chronisch <OR> Kokert </choose> underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said. 
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to <choose> get <TO> erhalten <OR> zu </choose> the help they need. 
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means <choose> thousands <TO> den <OR> tausende </choose> more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help. 
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to <choose> immediately <TO> umgehend <OR> CDU-Wahlkämpfers </choose> reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.

<choose> The <TO> die <OR> wurde </choose> device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros, even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet. 
<choose> However, <TO> jedoch <OR> beidseitig </choose> 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation. 
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had presented the product a <choose> couple <TO> durch <OR> paar </choose> of months previously at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover, billing it as "the office you can fit in your pocket". 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> sagt </choose> new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then: it could send and receive SMS messages and emails, and could even be contacted by fax. 
You could even access websites <choose> via <TO> per <OR> Schleichwege </choose> a HTML browser, even though it was painfully slow. 
There was a calculator, a digital address book and an <choose> electronic <TO> verfranste <OR> elektronischer </choose> calendar. 
There was a small antenna, and the phone <choose> could <TO> konnte <OR> an </choose> be folded open like a laptop. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> `` </choose> price was fairly high: 2700 deutschmarks, around 1400 euros. 
<choose> The <TO> Da <OR> der </choose> mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up. 
<choose> Today <TO> . <OR> heute </choose> the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nokia. 
<choose> For <TO> für <OR> geworden </choose> many people today, being online all day, no matter where you are, is simply a fact of life. 
Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple <choose> alone <TO> alleine <OR> . </choose> make up 555 million of them. 
<choose> Global <TO> weltweite <OR> lassen </choose> sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros. 
This is in addition to the flourishing businesses of <choose> innumerable <TO> zahllosen <OR> bei </choose> app providers and telecommunications firms. 
The decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007, when the Apple CEO at the time, Steve Jobs, <choose> announced <TO> . <OR> kündigte </choose> the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World. 
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator - and everything could be accessed <choose> easily <TO> leicht <OR> weniger </choose> via touchscreen. 
For our local communities <choose> alone <TO> alleine <OR> räumt </choose> we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport. 
Just as there were <choose> ahead <TO> die <OR> voraus </choose> of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great. 
I was told that Britain would be <choose> never <TO> nie <OR> Worte </choose> be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage. 
Expansion is an opportunity to <choose> create <TO> schaffen <OR> Das </choose> up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK. 
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - <choose> voted <TO> gewählt <OR> . </choose> the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways. 
Now they <choose> stand <TO> . <OR> stehen </choose> ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment. 
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and <choose> expand <TO> Wir <OR> erweitern </choose> Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of. 
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> Betrieb </choose> to one of the companies that makes that software. 
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus <choose> published <TO> veröffentlichte <OR> Die </choose> a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again. 
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would <choose> change <TO> ändern <OR> Vorteilen </choose> the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads. 
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams <choose> wrote <TO> schrieb <OR> Landkreisen </choose> that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon. 
The fact that the world's largest <choose> social <TO> soziale <OR> dass </choose> media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry. 
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> auf </choose> to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013. 
"This isn't a good experience for people and we <choose> plan <TO> planen <OR> jetzt </choose> to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.

NASA climate model: Venus was once <choose> habitable <TO> ist <OR> bewohnbar </choose> 
Venus was likely once habitable, <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> an </choose> to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Sicherheitspaket </choose> model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
Scientists have <choose> previously <TO> zuvor <OR> was </choose> suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere. 
But the latest simulation suggests Venus <choose> could <TO> könnte <OR> Und </choose> have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> Thomas </choose> model also looked at the topography of early Venus. 
Early Venus <choose> also <TO> bei <OR> auch </choose> benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.

<choose> The <TO> Parteien <OR> der </choose> result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> Auch </choose> model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a <choose> thick <TO> dicke <OR> . </choose> atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today. 
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a <choose> search <TO> kümmern <OR> suchen </choose> for a new coach immediately. 
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it <choose> needs <TO> benötigt <OR> und </choose> and bring it to a higher level.

Sakic, who <choose> hired <TO> den <OR> angeheuert </choose> Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team. 
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's <choose> best <TO> beste <OR> für </choose> coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14. 
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last <choose> two <TO> beiden <OR> keine </choose> years.

Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged <choose> sporadically <TO> sporadisch <OR> . </choose> on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell. 
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a <choose> joint <TO> gemeinsamen <OR> Land </choose> statement read. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> er </choose> labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent. 
Shell, for its part, has trimmed <choose> thousands <TO> tausenden <OR> rechtlich </choose> of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.

After his emotional announcement of retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the <choose> last <TO> letztes <OR> Burka-Verbot </choose> time on 12 August, against the Tampa Bay Rays. 
As far back as 2009 the superstar told ESPN that he had <choose> taken <TO> genommen <OR> sich </choose> banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.

"The league <choose> might <TO> könnte <OR> Wir </choose> even have done me a favour in 2014 - I'd played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said, summing things up.

Busted: After a sample tested <choose> positive <TO> Streit <OR> positiven </choose> for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio. 
<choose> The <TO> Doch <OR> die </choose> first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition. 
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and <choose> Polish <TO> polnische <OR> signalisiert </choose> weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil, and have been excluded. Just before the start of the athletics competition, which has not escaped criticism, this news comes at a bad time. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> kommt </choose> Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used to mask drugs. 
<choose> The <TO> das <OR> Auslieferungszahlen </choose> national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision". 
<choose> For <TO> Doch <OR> für </choose> the first time in history, the CAS, not the IOC, is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople who test positive. 
Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old <choose> went <TO> ging <OR> . </choose> on the offensive herself. 
"I had three tests, all of which were negative, and my <choose> fourth <TO> vierter <OR> den </choose> test was positive," which was "an unbelievable shock," she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT. 
She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation <choose> could <TO> weiter <OR> könnten </choose> be food supplements," the athlete explained. 
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and <choose> according <TO> laut <OR> das </choose> to BNT, a B sample also tested postive. 
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up <choose> immediately <TO> umgehend <OR> als </choose> to criticise the athlete. 
"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> . </choose> been banned". 
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested positive for the <choose> anabolic <TO> in <OR> anabole </choose> steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother. 
<choose> Both <TO> einigen <OR> beide </choose> deny taking it, but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> um </choose> World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception, for systematic doping, and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Rio.

Data theft: This is how perfidiously hackers <choose> extort <TO> erpressen <OR> glimpflich </choose> ransom money 
Programmers of extortion malware are <choose> currently <TO> aktuell <OR> Konzernvertriebschef </choose> targeting companies - with success. 
<choose> According <TO> laut <OR> in </choose> to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks. 
"We are <choose> currently <TO> manipuliert <OR> aktuell </choose> seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> . </choose> victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files. 
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up <choose> get <TO> bekommen <OR> , </choose> their files back. 
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a <choose> good <TO> Nach <OR> gute </choose> reputation. 
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do <choose> try <TO> versuchen <OR> . </choose> to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money. 
They explain to their victims <choose> via <TO> per <OR> . </choose> chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free. 
Faced with the <choose> potentially <TO> potenziell <OR> berichtet </choose> high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week." 
"The kits <choose> include <TO> enthalten <OR> VW-Vertreter </choose> an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be constructed, and the appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. 
Now, <choose> many <TO> vielen <OR> gab </choose> companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better. 
"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish <choose> sensitive <TO> zu <OR> sensiblen </choose> files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski. 
Honda wants to cram everything into the <choose> small <TO> kleinen <OR> . </choose> HR-V: a bit of an SUV, a bit of a coupé, bundled up with the versatility of a minivan. 
It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does <choose> indeed <TO> der <OR> tatsächlich </choose> prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use. 
<choose> The <TO> . <OR> der </choose> HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space.

In the evening your mind won't stop whirring, you lie awake for hours each night, and by the time <choose> morning <TO> morgens <OR> Beobachtung </choose> comes, sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off. 
If you suffer from these issues, you're in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders, and more than ten percent find that they <choose> often <TO> häufig <OR> Alters </choose> or always wake up not feeling refreshed. 
<choose> Many <TO> viele <OR> frage </choose> people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Association of General Practicioners, who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony. 
<choose> When <TO> . <OR> wann </choose> should you see your doctor about sleep disorders? 
If, over the course of a month, you <choose> sleep <TO> Platten <OR> schläft </choose> poorly for at least three nights a week, and find that this impacts you during the day, you should see a doctor, advises Weeß. 
They can impact in various <choose> different <TO> unterschiedlich <OR> die </choose> ways: You could be exhausted, tired, poorly rested, suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert, be irritable, have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches. 
There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the <choose> Interdisciplinary <TO> pleite <OR> interdisziplinären </choose> Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin. 
Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a <choose> physical <TO> war <OR> körperliche </choose> cause. 
You don't have to <choose> prepare <TO> vorbereiten <OR> und </choose> for the examination at all. 
There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a <choose> better <TO> die <OR> besseren </choose> night's sleep. 
Weeß lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching <choose> television <TO> fernsehen <OR> zu </choose> to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all. 
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the <choose> disappointing <TO> enttäuschenden <OR> Platten </choose> performance of the DSV team at the Olympics. 
"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle <choose> gets <TO> Boom <OR> bekommt </choose> 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.

Airport: A gang of luggage thieves are <choose> arrested <TO> festgenommen <OR> von </choose> 
Around 9.30 p.m. civil servants in Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang <choose> known <TO> bekannt <OR> Wez </choose> to the police from previous thefts. 
The two men and two women had committed multiple crimes since mid-July, and had committed the offences as a group, dividing up their work in a particularly <choose> professional <TO> professionell <OR> die </choose> way. 
<choose> The <TO> Leere <OR> den </choose> specialists from the 34th police inspectorate were able to prove that the thieves, who had travelled to Germany to commit the crimes, had committed four crimes. 
<choose> They <TO> beschäftigen <OR> sie </choose> had made more than 15,000 euros as a result. 
If you walk along the street from east to west, you <choose> come <TO> kommt <OR> wie </choose> across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop. 
<choose> Someone <TO> % <OR> jemand </choose> has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house. 
Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is <choose> already <TO> schon <OR> 41 </choose> underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed. 
<choose> The <TO> der <OR> . </choose> reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events. 
Berlin's Senator of the Interior Henkel had called multiple times since the start of the year for the police to take a hard line against the project that has made the area a "no-go zone" for police and singled out 94 as the starting point for <choose> autonomous <TO> `` <OR> autonomer </choose> violence. 
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were <choose> cleared <TO> geräumt <OR> , </choose> on 22 June by 300 police officers, the police patrolled the area for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three vans, closing parts of the street and preventing visitors from accessing house 94. 
During this period, builders <choose> renovated <TO> definitiv <OR> renovierten </choose> the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house. 
On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, <choose> one <TO> einen <OR> Mehr </choose> day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents. 
On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were <choose> sitting <TO> sitzen <OR> habe </choose> on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence. 
<choose> They <TO> erst <OR> sie </choose> share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification. 
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. <choose> Even <TO> auch <OR> , </choose> today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city. 
Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including <choose> almost <TO> nahezu <OR> Teenagejungs </choose> all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer. 
While those on Mainzerstraße were <choose> cleared <TO> geräumt <OR> den </choose> out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago. 
<choose> The <TO> sonderlich <OR> der </choose> majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties. 
<choose> The <TO> die <OR> betrachtet </choose> trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite: "Here we help each other, live together along the street, and talk to each other more than elsewhere".
