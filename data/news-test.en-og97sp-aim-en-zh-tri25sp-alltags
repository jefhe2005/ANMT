28-Year-Old Chef Found <choose> Dead <TO> 死 </choose> at San Francisco Mall 
A 28-year-old chef who had <choose> recently <TO> 近日 </choose> moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week. 
<choose> But <TO> 但 </choose> the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." 
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday <choose> morning <TO> 早上 </choose> was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. 
The San Francisco Police Department said the <choose> death <TO> 死亡 </choose> was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing. 
"We are a <choose> small <TO> 小 </choose> team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said. 
Our thoughts and <choose> condolences <TO> 哀悼 </choose> are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time. 
He was a <choose> kind <TO> 善良 </choose> spirit with a big heart. 
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the <choose> rough <TO> 粗 </choose> that was shining bright every day," he said. 
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract <choose> deal <TO> 交易 </choose> agreed with the BMA. 
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has <choose> today <TO> 今日 </choose> made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September. 
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the <choose> vote <TO> 投票 </choose> to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended. 
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the <choose> poll <TO> 投票 </choose> of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students. 
But Mr Putin's <choose> smile <TO> 微笑 </choose> looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards. 
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but <choose> even <TO> 甚至 </choose> higher. 
<choose> All <TO> 所有 </choose> of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything. 
There is <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> an economic motive. 
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has <choose> recently <TO> 近日 </choose> been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides. 
During that time, brand strategists have <choose> used <TO> 使用 </choose> 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands. 
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion <choose> Andy <TO> 安迪 </choose> Murray. 
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock <choose> exchange <TO> 交易所 </choose> listing, will be changed to NatWest. 
There are other, smaller brands for <choose> private <TO> 私人 </choose> banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its <choose> Six <TO> 六 </choose> Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship. 
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the <choose> chief <TO> 首席 </choose> executive. 
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and <choose> retired <TO> 退役 </choose> 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career. 
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the <choose> best <TO> 最好 </choose> part of 30 years which is great to see. 
He's a lively <choose> character <TO> 性格 </choose> which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey. 
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban. 
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of <choose> character <TO> 性格 </choose> to defy the doubters and return to his best. 
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's <choose> trusted <TO> 信任 </choose> inner circle for many years. 
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and <choose> transport <TO> 交通 </choose> issues. 
<choose> Born <TO> 出生 </choose> in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy. 
<choose> But <TO> 但是 </choose> the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, <choose> quoted <TO> 引述 </choose> on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> second <TO> 第二 </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional. 
<choose> Mystery <TO> 神秘 </choose> as fish land in Banff garden 
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope <choose> someone <TO> 有人 </choose> could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish. 
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's <choose> north <TO> 北 </choose> deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife. 
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing <choose> completion <TO> 竣工 </choose> around each of the bridge's three towers. 
Economy Secretary Keith <choose> Brown <TO> 布朗 </choose> visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge. 
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel <choose> used <TO> 使用 </choose> just to build this part of the bridge. 
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining <choose> gap <TO> 缺口 </choose> on the north - or landward - side. 
This was <choose> done <TO> 完成 </choose> by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards. 
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were <choose> tiny <TO> 小 </choose> - just a few millimetres either way. 
Biles became the fourth straight American <choose> woman <TO> 女子 </choose> to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever. 
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of <choose> ambition <TO> 志向 </choose> and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen." 
Anything less than heading back to her family's <choose> home <TO> 家 </choose> in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment. 
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to <choose> Latin <TO> 拉丁 </choose> music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena. 
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field <choose> trip <TO> 旅行 </choose> to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force. 
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final <choose> score <TO> 比分 </choose> - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality. 
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for <choose> third <TO> 第三 </choose> but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker. 
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, <choose> arm <TO> 胳膊 </choose> and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital. 
The boy is listed in <choose> critical <TO> 危急 </choose> condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries. 
<choose> Family <TO> 家人 </choose> tells the station he is expected to recover. 
The <choose> child <TO> 孩子 </choose> was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports. 
No arrests have been made and <choose> police <TO> 警察 </choose> are reportedly reviewing surveillance video. 
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her <choose> arm <TO> 胳膊 </choose> by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood. 
She is recovering, and <choose> police <TO> 警察 </choose> are still searching for a suspect. 
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young <choose> girls <TO> 女孩 </choose> of color. 
This team looks, finally, <choose> like <TO> 像 </choose> America. 
It also has solidified the black and Latina <choose> female <TO> 女性 </choose> presence at the top of this sport. 
For the past four years, the number one <choose> female <TO> 女 </choose> gymnast has been African-American. 
<choose> But <TO> 但是 </choose> the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
<choose> Most <TO> 大部分 </choose> of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business. 
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young <choose> girls <TO> 女孩 </choose> who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. 
In September, we will be expanding to <choose> Detroit <TO> 底特律 </choose> (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport. 
To participate in sport is so important, <choose> especially <TO> 尤其 </choose> for girls. 
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young <choose> girls <TO> 女孩 </choose> of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women. 
The <choose> first <TO> 首先 </choose> junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours. 
The <choose> last <TO> 上次 </choose> strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. 
Daniel Mortimer, <choose> chief <TO> 首席 </choose> executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes. 
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian <choose> Role <TO> 角色 </choose> and Whistleblowing. 
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, <choose> costs <TO> 成本 </choose> of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May. 
<choose> But <TO> 但是 </choose> now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems. 
People who have already have one attack are at a <choose> higher <TO> 更高 </choose> risk of having another. 
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to <choose> benefit <TO> 受益 </choose> from it. 
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of <choose> bleeding <TO> 出血 </choose> - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period. 
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting <choose> fraud <TO> 舞弊 </choose> in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today. 
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that <choose> police <TO> 警方 </choose> should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters. 
The report even suggests putting indelible <choose> ink <TO> 墨水 </choose> on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice. 
Last year a special election <choose> court <TO> 法庭 </choose> ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices. 
The <choose> court <TO> 法庭 </choose> found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia. 
Sir Eric said there was evidence of <choose> fraud <TO> 舞弊 </choose> across the country. 
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting <choose> fraud <TO> 舞弊 </choose> - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing. 
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some <choose> ethnic <TO> 族裔 </choose> minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background. 
The report, being considered by Theresa May, <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud. 
Use indelible <choose> ink <TO> 墨水 </choose> on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice. 
Give <choose> police <TO> 警方 </choose> powers to set up cordons around polling stations. 
"The election <choose> court <TO> 法庭 </choose> disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. 
He was found <choose> guilty <TO> 有罪 </choose> beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds. 
Sir Eric said: "Last year's <choose> court <TO> 法庭 </choose> ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.

Other <choose> popular <TO> 流行 </choose> comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.

Primark shopper outraged at <choose> woman <TO> 女子 </choose> who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop 
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a <choose> woman <TO> 女子 </choose> stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark. 
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the <choose> woman <TO> 女子 </choose> tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf 
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the <choose> shop <TO> 店 </choose> at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.' 
Standing in the middle of the <choose> shop <TO> 店 </choose> floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on. 
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think <choose> someone <TO> 有人 </choose> is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.' 
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another <choose> woman <TO> 女人 </choose> had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'

You then grasp the gun between your <choose> forearm <TO> 前臂 </choose> and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow. 
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar <choose> technique <TO> 技巧 </choose> - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire. 
At the same time, put <choose> weight <TO> 重量 </choose> on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him. 
<choose> But <TO> 但是 </choose> remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash. 
A <choose> family <TO> 家庭 </choose> of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours. 
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, <choose> rubbish <TO> 垃圾 </choose> was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.

This was a very difficult <choose> case <TO> 案件 </choose> as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness. 
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall <choose> Police <TO> 警方 </choose> and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.

She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both <choose> walking <TO> 走路 </choose> and sleeping. 
According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither <choose> supplies <TO> 用品 </choose> nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamonds should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, the people who carry them shall be classified as smuggling and may be sentenced to jail. 
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her <choose> summer <TO> 暑假 </choose> vacation, but did not disclose the specific place. 
Teresa <choose> Mei <TO> 梅 </choose> chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that a United Kingdom prime minister chose to go vacation in Switzerland after Margaret Thatcher, according to the United Kingdom newspaper Daily Telegraph. 
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the <choose> vacation <TO> 度假 </choose> selection of hotter places by Blair and Cameron 
It is reported that the <choose> new <TO> 新 </choose> United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to Rondon on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her. 
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its category number and quantity rank <choose> first <TO> 第一 </choose> in Anhui Province. 
Hua Jianhui pointed out that this was the first time that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of <choose> vertical <TO> 垂直 </choose> administration department and carry out special inquiries. It is the active exploration for enhancing and exploring the supervision work of the Provincial People's Congress. 
China's <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 </choose> program kicks off 
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most <choose> energy <TO> 能量 </choose> efficient to launch the vehicle." 
Currently, the Mars has become the <choose> planet <TO> 行星 </choose> with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration. 
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a <choose> base <TO> 基地 </choose> of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind. 
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of <choose> evolution <TO> 演化 </choose> to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc. 
Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for <choose> research <TO> 研究 </choose> can help propose a pre-arranged planning of preventing Earth from becoming the second Mars. 
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the <choose> Martian <TO> 火星 </choose> atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration. 
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with <choose> high <TO> 高 </choose> uncertainty. 
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the <choose> energy <TO> 能源 </choose> supply for Mars detection. 
This requires that the detector's sun <choose> wing <TO> 翼 </choose> area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction. 
In addition, since the <choose> gravity <TO> 重力 </choose> of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power. 
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the <choose> high <TO> 高 </choose> speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth. 
The way to detect the Mars is <choose> similar <TO> 相似 </choose> to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao. 
Lin Quan <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> announced that Hong Peigen, "Deputy Director of the Independent Commission against Corruption", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.

Zhan Qixian <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch.

Balance between supply and demand will affect the average users, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the <choose> first <TO> 第一 </choose> time. 
Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, <choose> lower <TO> 低 </choose> prices and more intimate services will surely be brought to users.

In order to remind people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new <choose> beak <TO> 喙 </choose> color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material. 
The <choose> beak <TO> 喙 </choose> is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support. 
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's <choose> beak <TO> 喙 </choose> is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt. 
Now Gracia can use the new <choose> beak <TO> 喙 </choose> to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains.

People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its <choose> life <TO> 生活 </choose> before hurting. 
<choose> Even <TO> 甚至 </choose> the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was also involved in the design of the Gracia beak. 
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual <choose> beak <TO> 喙 </choose> is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak." 
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and fixed it on its <choose> beak <TO> 喙 </choose> with glue." 
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken <choose> beak <TO> 喙 </choose> of Gracia every day to prevent infection. 
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal <choose> Planet <TO> 星球 </choose> Channel.

Observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan's <choose> generosity <TO> 慷慨 </choose> toward Africa: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. 
To achieve its own goals, Japan should firstly get along with the surrounding countries. <choose> And <TO> 和 </choose> Japan needs to have a correct attitude in geopolitical competition, national dispute or understanding of a historical problem. 
<choose> Haikou <TO> 海口 </choose> Maritime Court registers a case in the early morning to ensure the rights and interests of litigants of Lingao sinking boat

On the evening of the 11th day of the month, China National Peking Opera Theater traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City along with its famous TV play "White Snake". They presented the local people with an authentic Peking Opera <choose> feast <TO> 盛宴 </choose> in the Mexican National Palace. 
Liu Cigui stressed that Sanya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and give full play to its leading <choose> role <TO> 作用 </choose> of demonstration in the province's economic and social development process by means of the significant pilot work of "Double Restoration and Dual City".

There was <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glories for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the newcomers and cultivated a great number of champions. 
Many NBA players have proved their strength. <choose> But <TO> 但是 </choose> whenever there is progress, there is a setback. 
Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the <choose> Bulls <TO> 公牛 </choose> is not so good as that of the Miami Heat. 
The backcourt <choose> range <TO> 射程 </choose> of he and Rondo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite congested. 
Okafor's situation is a bit embarrassing. As the <choose> first <TO> 第一 </choose> choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Embiid in the new season. 
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Embiid must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a <choose> position <TO> 位置 </choose> in the long array of the 76ers remains a question. 
Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor came from low position attacks. The <choose> ratio <TO> 比例 </choose> is higher than Cousins, Vukcevic and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league. 
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's <choose> defense <TO> 防守 </choose> difficulty. 
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battle in a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the <choose> oil <TO> 油 </choose> tank of French sports car is not much left. 
Therefore, in the regular season, James's capability is likely to further decline. He will share more with Owen, but he will still easily become one of the league's top <choose> three <TO> 三 </choose> players. 
Huang Jing, <choose> chairman <TO> 主席 </choose> of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association said excitedly on the 12th day of the month of the local time while she was interviewed by a reporter of Chinanews.com.

At the 15th minute, Zhang Xizhe flipped through along a straight line of the midfield. Yilmaz had broken into the penalty area directly and the only defender, Liu Yu, took the lead in kicking the <choose> ball <TO> 球 </choose> away. 
Just at the beginning of the next half, Fernando won a free kick on the right side with an abrupt breakthrough. It was a <choose> pity <TO> 可惜 </choose> that he kicked the ball too high in small angle and missed the goal. 
One minute later, Fernando showed his long-range raid capability on the right again. His pursuer Yu Dabao fouled and <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> got a yellow card. 
Yilmaz made a forceful breakthrough on the penalty area line, but tumbled when Zheng Yourong stretched a leg to stop him, which led the <choose> referee <TO> 裁判 </choose> to determine a penalty. Yilmaz kicked a successful penalty goal, as a result the score board was: Lifan 2:1 Beijing Guoan. 
After the 4-minute allowance, Lifan kept the 2-1 <choose> score <TO> 比分 </choose> until the end of the final and defeated Guoan in the visiting field.

It was <choose> like <TO> 像 </choose> running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner. 
<choose> Dan <TO> 丹 </choose> Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands. 
Kyle <choose> Brown <TO> 布朗 </choose> put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.

Snapchat "Anime" <choose> Effect <TO> 效果 </choose> Is Criticized as Asian Caricature 
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a <choose> character <TO> 角色 </choose> befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting. 
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie <choose> Zhu <TO> 朱 </choose> said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before." 
Ms. <choose> Zhu <TO> 朱 </choose> criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat. 
Other observers <choose> share <TO> 分享 </choose> her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered. 
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a <choose> private <TO> 私人 </choose> company. 
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company <choose> recently <TO> 近期 </choose> hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally. 
For her part, Ms. <choose> Zhu <TO> 朱 </choose> said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K." 
Officials from the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 </choose> Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday. 
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior <choose> policy <TO> 政策 </choose> makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 </choose> Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq. 
General Austin <choose> retired <TO> 退役 </choose> in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel. 
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field <choose> hockey <TO> 曲棍球 </choose> team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0. 
The first-place finisher will <choose> avoid <TO> 避免 </choose> the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin. 
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field <choose> hockey <TO> 曲棍球 </choose> stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever. 
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a <choose> backhand <TO> 反手 </choose> shot from close in. 
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the <choose> score <TO> 比分 </choose> 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge. 
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed <choose> one <TO> 一 </choose> goal in each of the first three victories. 
The Depressing <choose> Food <TO> 食物 </choose> of the Depression, in "A Square Meal" 
His menu that day was more humble: deviled <choose> eggs <TO> 蛋 </choose> in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding. 
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," <choose> Jane <TO> 珍 </choose> Ziegelman said. 
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are <choose> food <TO> 食品 </choose> historians. 
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese <choose> cuisine <TO> 菜 </choose> in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be <choose> published <TO> 出版 </choose> Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression. 
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a <choose> cream <TO> 奶油 </choose> cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. 
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the <choose> couple <TO> 夫妻 </choose> deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating. 
There was <choose> peanut <TO> 花生 </choose> loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf. 
They were made from an ingredient and a <choose> cheap <TO> 便宜 </choose> thing that stretches the ingredient out. 
<choose> Imagine <TO> 想象 </choose> eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner. 
"It must have sat in your stomach <choose> like <TO> 像 </choose> lead," he said. 
In the years before the Depression, the American table, <choose> especially <TO> 尤其 </choose> in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Teams of women cooked for <choose> male <TO> 男 </choose> farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
"This was a time when <choose> food <TO> 食物 </choose> became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it. 
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a <choose> creamy <TO> 奶油 </choose> coating of sauce. 
Fresh fruit was replaced with <choose> cheaper <TO> 便宜 </choose> dried fruit. 
<choose> Strange <TO> 奇怪 </choose> mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense. 
In researching the book, which <choose> includes <TO> 包括 </choose> recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter. 
"It was not a popular addition to the <choose> dinner <TO> 晚餐 </choose> table," Mr. Coe said. 
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged <choose> women <TO> 女性 </choose> to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes. 
<choose> Especially <TO> 尤其 </choose> savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. 
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's <choose> hiring <TO> 聘用 </choose> of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared." 
The legacy is in our continued focus on <choose> calories <TO> 卡路里 </choose> and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking. 
The <choose> couple <TO> 夫妻 </choose> said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance. 
"She had a real fear of <choose> food <TO> 食物 </choose> waste," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got <choose> people <TO> 人 </choose> sick." 
<choose> Everyone <TO> 大家 </choose> reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo. 
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped <choose> walnuts <TO> 核桃 </choose> would help." 
It is a <choose> pity <TO> 可惜 </choose> that OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high.

Not long ago, Nubia <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> launched the first work of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini. 
Z11mini, a small screen camera phone which was just <choose> listed <TO> 上市 </choose> by Nubia, had a price fall of RMB 200, decreasing from the original RMB 1,499 to RMB 1,299. 
In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen. The classic "little red circle" design is at the <choose> bottom <TO> 下方 </choose> of the obverse side. 
The middle frame is made of metal material. Its <choose> bottom <TO> 底部 </choose> adopts symmetrical design and is equipped with a Type-C data interface.

In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, <choose> victims <TO> 受害人 </choose> of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation. 
From <choose> June <TO> 六月 </choose> next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding. 
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the <choose> latest <TO> 最新 </choose> National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year. 
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be <choose> forced <TO> 被迫 </choose> to navigate complex legal problems without help. 
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they <choose> need <TO> 需要 </choose> when they're faced with a legal problem. 
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state <choose> court <TO> 法庭 </choose> in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign. 
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other <choose> people <TO> 人 </choose> had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing. 
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second <choose> Amendment <TO> 修正案 </choose> people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges. 
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip <choose> recently <TO> 近期 </choose> left the campaign. 
Heathrow will <choose> also <TO> 也 </choose> deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country. 
For our <choose> local <TO> 本地 </choose> communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport. 
The London 2012 Games were a great <choose> success <TO> 成功 </choose> for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.

Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call <choose> police <TO> 警方 </choose> on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44. 
NASA climate model: <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 </choose> was once habitable 
<choose> Venus <TO> 金星 </choose> was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for <choose> Space <TO> 太空 </choose> Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists. 
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less <choose> surface <TO> 表面 </choose> and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
But the <choose> latest <TO> 最新 </choose> simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
Early <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 </choose> also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer. 
This warms the surface and produces <choose> rain <TO> 雨水 </choose> that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
The model produced a story of <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 </choose> similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
Though likely once habitable, <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 </choose> was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 </choose> we know today. 
Researchers shared the results of their new <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 </choose> climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
Patrick Roy resigns as <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 </choose> coach 
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 </choose> on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process. 
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 </choose> with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement. 
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 </choose> in 2013-14. 
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the <choose> first <TO> 第一 </choose> round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years. 
The <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 </choose> posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference. 
The labor unions said their <choose> recent <TO> 近期 </choose> action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.

Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in <choose> June <TO> 六月 </choose> to leave the European Union. 
The latest mission by the Kepler <choose> space <TO> 太空 </choose> telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster. 
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to <choose> planet <TO> 星球 </choose> formation. 
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a <choose> research <TO> 研究 </choose> scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release. 
The <choose> latest <TO> 最新 </choose> catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars. 
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical <choose> models <TO> 模型 </choose> of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull. 
"Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of <choose> rowing <TO> 划船 </choose> tourists will wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely." Zheng Jianjun said. 
Among the three lines of <choose> introducing <TO> 引入 </choose> sweet potato, the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and the widest spread. 
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who <choose> share <TO> 分享 </choose> stories in social media," said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the Olympic Games communication strategy in 2012. 
It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the <choose> world <TO> 世界 </choose> will have to meet this round of challenges. 
August 11 was the last day for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares. A source said that there is nothing special in the market response during the first two days of the IPO. According to the plan, it will be <choose> listed <TO> 上市 </choose> on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18. 
Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness, many brokers sagged this year in results. But the situations of securities firms after their <choose> listing <TO> 上市 </choose> are dependent on the detailed development performance of their businesses and cannot be generalized. 
In addition to Suzhou, other second-tier cities including Hefei and <choose> Nanjing <TO> 南京 </choose> will also introduce property market regulations and control policies.
