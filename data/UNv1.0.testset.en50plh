We urge the <nulltag> States </nulltag> of the <nulltag> "nuclear </nulltag> five" -- which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) -- to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible, which will make it possible to complete the process of formally institutionalizing the zone and to markedly raise the level of mutual trust and security.

At the same time, a <nulltag> preliminary </nulltag> assessment of "fast-start finance" -- new and additional resources pledged in 2009 by developed countries for climate change mitigation and adaptation during the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -- found that 80 per cent of these flows were also counted as ODA and were paid out with similar modalities, largely through bilateral channels. 
In that <nulltag> context, </nulltag> the Development Cooperation Forum could provide a suitable platform for global mutual accountability while the special high-level meeting could continue to provide a forum for Governments, the major institutional stakeholders, civil society and the business sector to coordinate their implementation efforts in the context of the post-2015 development agenda.

For the peoples of the States members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, 9 May 1945 is a <nulltag> sacred </nulltag> day and one of the most important and <nulltag> respected </nulltag> dates. 
We are eternally indebted to those who <nulltag> fell </nulltag> in the <nulltag> war </nulltag> and we bow our heads before the graves of those who died on the battlefields, of those who were tormented in concentration camps and fascist torture chambers and of those who lost their lives due to famine and hardships.

The <nulltag> conference </nulltag> will <nulltag> take </nulltag> place under the auspices of the General Secretariat of the Gulf Cooperation Council, upon the request of President Hadi to his counterparts in the Gulf Cooperation Council, of 5 March 2015. 
The <nulltag> Kingdom </nulltag> of Morocco considers totally <nulltag> unacceptable </nulltag> the recent manoeuvring by the African Union in <nulltag> requesting </nulltag> an interaction between its "Special Envoy", Mr. Joaquim Chissano, and the Security Council. 
For its <nulltag> part, </nulltag> the Kingdom of Morocco would <nulltag> like </nulltag> to reiterate, once <nulltag> again, </nulltag> its commitment to the process of political negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. 
<nulltag> c. </nulltag> Training <nulltag> workshops </nulltag> or field trips for journalists to United Nations project sites, in cooperation with the local United Nations system partners, for local journalists in order to promote <nulltag> better </nulltag> understanding of United Nations issues, and organization of training sessions for local United Nations librarians (4).

To be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Wednesday, </nulltag> 18 March 2015, at 10.33 a.m. 
The strengthening of the United States dollar could, however, presage some widening of global imbalances in the outlook period, albeit not to the levels seen during the period 2006-2008.
With <nulltag> GDP </nulltag> growth slowing, employment growth is <nulltag> declining, </nulltag> while gender gaps are often widening. 
31. In its 2014 resolution <nulltag> entitled </nulltag> "Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of Agency safeguards", the General Conference welcomed, with Brazil's support, the clarifications and <nulltag> additional </nulltag> information provided by the secretariat in the supplementary document. 
Brazil is therefore fully supportive of multilateral efforts aimed at preserving and reinforcing compliance with the non-proliferation obligations of the Treaty, notably through IAEA.
It is <nulltag> suggested </nulltag> that institutions at all levels will need to undertake adaptations to implement the new development agenda, requiring a fundamental shift in mindsets and attitudes accompanied by strong leadership and vision. 
That shift will <nulltag> need </nulltag> to take the form of engaging in policy dialogue that cut across sectoral or political interests with input from a cross section of groups. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> enclose </nulltag> herewith a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, M. Javad Zarif, regarding the extremely alarming situation in Yemen. 
They have also indiscriminately targeted residential areas, including refugee camps, killing and injuring innocent civilians, in particular women and children.
25. The <nulltag> Office </nulltag> of Information and Communications Technology will <nulltag> focus </nulltag> on establishing enterprise architecture, will lead the strengthening of Umoja mainstreaming, information security and operational resilience and will ensure that ICT programmes are aligned with the core work of the United Nations. 
10. In order to support the Secretary-General's proposals on how objectives of the Organization, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement, as set out in the <nulltag> biennial </nulltag> programme plan, could be improved to indicate more clearly the impact of the activities implemented, a review of those elements approved for the bienniums 2006-2007 and 2016-2017 was undertaken. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Ms. Kara-Kys Arakchaa 
7. Notes the <nulltag> efforts </nulltag> made by the Secretary-General to establish the supply chain module in Umoja, also notes the improved governance of procurement functions to include procurement operations in peacekeeping missions, special political missions, offices away from Headquarters and tribunals while establishing a clear responsibility and accountability framework, and requests the Secretary-General to provide enhanced visibility of information on vendors that are awarded contracts and purchase orders; 
18A.128 During the biennium <nulltag> 2016-2017, </nulltag> <nulltag> projected </nulltag> extrabudgetary resources amounting to $437,100 would provide for one Local level post and will contribute to building the capacities of national statistics offices of Central Africa in the use of modern technologies for the collection and processing of comparable and harmonized statistics. 
The <nulltag> human </nulltag> <nulltag> cost </nulltag> of the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons 
In the <nulltag> opinion </nulltag> of the Secretary-General, that letter constitutes adequate provisional credentials. 
<nulltag> Important </nulltag> <nulltag> principles </nulltag> that constitute good governance include: stakeholder engagement or participation, fairness, accountability, transparency, efficiency and effectiveness (from Bodegom et al. 2012, An approach for integrating forest governance into national forest-related monitoring systems, FAO Forestry Policy and Institutions Working Paper No. 29, Rome). 
This challenging situation points to the need for renewed negotiations with <nulltag> international </nulltag> financial institutions, primarily IMF, on a new financial arrangement, or the identification of alternative sources of financing, which are likely to be either difficult to obtain or far less favourable. 
The <nulltag> order </nulltag> specified that it should apply especially to decisions regarding new appointments and hiring. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The Permanent Forum <nulltag> welcomes </nulltag> the participation of United Nations and indigenous experts in the panel discussion on the proposed indigenous peoples development index.

<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to rule 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received credentials signed on 8 May 2015 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand stating that Mr. Gerardus Jacobus van Bohemen has been appointed representative of New Zealand on the Security Council.

During this <nulltag> first </nulltag> <nulltag> visit, </nulltag> which coincided with the opening of the Bangui Forum, I held discussions with representatives of the civil society and the international community based in Bangui as well as with the transitional authorities, to seek their views on the priority aspects for the engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission in the Central African Republic, at a crucial junction of the political process. 
In my <nulltag> capacity </nulltag> as Chair of the Central African Republic configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission, I <nulltag> visited </nulltag> Bangui from 2 to 5 May 2015. 
At the <nulltag> end </nulltag> of February, LJM split and <nulltag> formed </nulltag> two <nulltag> new </nulltag> political parties, one led by the former Chair of LJM, Tijani al-Sissi, the other by Secretary Bahar Idriss Abu Garda.

<nulltag> Myanmar </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Mission </nulltag> mandates, in particular on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security sector reform, should be <nulltag> designed </nulltag> on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of short-, medium- and long-term security needs. 
51. <nulltag> Consistent </nulltag> <nulltag> application </nulltag> of the robust International Ammunition Technical Guidelines is essential. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> police </nulltag> officer who seizes property is the administrator of that property (s. 255, POCA). 
<nulltag> Sections </nulltag> 251, 252, 254, 258 and 261-265 of POCA provide for production or <nulltag> monitoring </nulltag> orders against property under certain conditions to prevent the dealing or disposal of the property, as well as search and seizure of suspected tainted or other property under a search warrant, or without in emergencies. 
The <nulltag> dates </nulltag> <nulltag> given </nulltag> for each item indicate when the item was first taken up by the Council at a formal meeting, and the most <nulltag> recent </nulltag> formal meeting of the Council held on that item.

<nulltag> Accordingly, </nulltag> I <nulltag> wish </nulltag> to inform you that, after consulting with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2206 (2015) concerning South Sudan, I have appointed the following experts: 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have designated Mr. Vladimir Zhagora to serve as Coordinator of the Panel of Experts. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran has always supported the United <nulltag> Nations-led </nulltag> efforts in restoring peace and stability in Yemen and fully abides by its strong commitment to the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Yemen. 
It stokes and exacerbates the <nulltag> ongoing </nulltag> <nulltag> conflict </nulltag> in the country, and, if unchecked, will turn it into a protracted torment. 
In our view, in order to <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> sufficient time for all the considerations, now is the time to start the process. 
In order to <nulltag> access </nulltag> <nulltag> documents, </nulltag> a court order is needed. 
Money-laundering, concealment (arts. 23 and 24)

Nor are <nulltag> human </nulltag> <nulltag> resources </nulltag> allotted strategically for dissemination purposes. 
<nulltag> Underlining, </nulltag> <nulltag> therefore, </nulltag> the necessity to take measures to safeguard and protect the <nulltag> tangible </nulltag> and intangible heritage of communities against the effects of armed conflict at all times,

<nulltag> Physicians </nulltag> for Human Rights has <nulltag> found </nulltag> that <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> regime forces are responsible for 97 per cent of medical personnel deaths throughout the past four years and 88 per cent of deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on medical facilities. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> items 68 (c) and 107 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> have designated <nulltag> Mr. </nulltag> Hugh Griffiths to serve as Coordinator of the Panel of Experts. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> refer </nulltag> to Security Council resolution 2207 (2015), by which the Council decided to extend until 5 April 2016 the mandate of the Panel of Experts, as specified in paragraph 26 of resolution 1874 (2009), and requested me to take the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> administrative measures to that effect. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Agenda </nulltag> item 163 
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework results matrices are also <nulltag> available </nulltag> through the UNICEF Executive Board <nulltag> website. </nulltag> 
7. The <nulltag> Secretariat </nulltag> will continue to brief States Parties in The Hague on the aforementioned destruction activities.

With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to the finalization of the <nulltag> first </nulltag> cycle, several States <nulltag> stated </nulltag> that an end-of-cycle product would be required. 
The practice of convening donor meetings or holding specific discussions on technical assistance during the direct dialogue was also noted as useful.
It is clear that the continued <nulltag> presence </nulltag> of such a gap in the commitments within and outside the Treaty reflects negatively on both its nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives. 
In <nulltag> order </nulltag> to <nulltag> address </nulltag> the gap, it is crucial to take progressive measures to restrict and prevent cooperation with such States in accordance with terms identified under the Treaty and under the relevant decisions of Review Conferences in that regard. 
In accordance with rule 55 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council, the following communiqué was <nulltag> issued </nulltag> through the Secretary-General in place of a verbatim record:

The <nulltag> Government </nulltag> of Iraq asked the United States to lead <nulltag> international </nulltag> efforts to strike ISIL sites and military strongholds in Syria in order to end the continuing attacks on Iraq, to protect Iraqi citizens, and ultimately to enable Iraqi forces to regain control of Iraq's borders.

<nulltag> Note </nulltag> by the Secretariat 
113. The <nulltag> Special </nulltag> <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> stresses that peacekeeping operations need to be complemented with activities aimed at effectively improving the living conditions of the affected populations, including quick implementation of highly effective and visible projects that help to create jobs and deliver basic social services in the postconflict phase. 
The Special Committee also notes with appreciation the efforts to update training programmes and materials, all of which are critical to ensuring that there is an effective and comprehensive response, including preventive measures, with respect to child protection.
On 25 <nulltag> May </nulltag> 2015, an air strike conducted by the coalition led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hit close to the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Sana'a, causing severe damage to the building and property of the Embassy.

<nulltag> Good </nulltag> governance, effective institutions, peace and stability are found to be both enablers and outcomes of development, and taking into account this interconnection will be of great importance for implementation of the post-2015 development agenda. 
Among the <nulltag> different </nulltag> <nulltag> dimensions </nulltag> of gender equality, economic empowerment <nulltag> appears </nulltag> to have a central role. 
In <nulltag> addition, </nulltag> MINUSCA <nulltag> started </nulltag> to engage with potential partners for the reintegration phase. 
The <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> <nulltag> demonstrated </nulltag> continuing <nulltag> international </nulltag> support to the transition process and recognized progress made by the Transitional Authorities to advance the political process, but did not result in new pledges to bridge significant gaps in funding for the electoral process or to support the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process. 
<nulltag> Legislative </nulltag> decision. 
<nulltag> Recognizing </nulltag> the indispensable <nulltag> role </nulltag> of crime prevention and criminal justice responses in combating all forms and aspects of trafficking in cultural property and related offences in a comprehensive and effective manner, 
13. <nulltag> Encourages </nulltag> States that are not already parties to <nulltag> consider </nulltag> ratifying or acceding to relevant legal instruments, in particular the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property; 
The <nulltag> Director </nulltag> General <nulltag> assumes </nulltag> that, for the 2016-2017 biennium, most Member States will continue to meet their obligations. 
<nulltag> Report </nulltag> of the Director, Evaluation Office 
To that end, we participate in multilateral, regional and bilateral initiatives that have the political aim of finding mechanisms for discussion and analysis to achieve the objective of a nuclear-weapon-free world.
5. <nulltag> Chile </nulltag> is an active member of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI), which aims to implement the plan of action proposed at the most recent Conference of the Parties. 
Completion of the new HACT e-learning course is mandatory for all staff who <nulltag> manage </nulltag> resources and results that include cash transfers to partners. 
11. UNICEF <nulltag> management </nulltag> notes that of the 39 audit reports of UNICEF offices and functions issued in 2014, 3 had an <nulltag> overall </nulltag> `unqualified' rating (indicating fully satisfactory controls) and 22 had a `moderately qualified' rating. 
Such trauma can <nulltag> lead </nulltag> to desperation and hopelessness, with indigenous communities frequently seeing suicide rates that are significantly higher than among the general population. 
7. The <nulltag> Permanent </nulltag> Forum: 
The Sultanate of Oman is committed to implementing Security Council resolution 2140 (2014) and has taken all steps necessary to implement effectively the measures imposed by paragraph 11 (asset freeze) and paragraph 15 (travel ban) of the above-mentioned resolution.
With regard to the ceremony, I <nulltag> intend </nulltag> to move it to coincide with the peacekeeping summit to be held in September 2015, in the context of the <nulltag> seventieth </nulltag> anniversary of the United Nations, to elevate the profile of the Medal and, by extension, to honour the work of the military, police and civilian United Nations personnel and associated personnel in the service of humanity. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> the <nulltag> absence </nulltag> of a response from the Security Council, I have proceeded with the implementation of resolution 2154 (2014) along the lines of my letter of 16 December 2014 and requested nominations from all United Nations field missions. 
In <nulltag> terms </nulltag> of internet searches <nulltag> (para. </nulltag> 114 of the <nulltag> final </nulltag> evaluation report), Google trends (figure 6) or citations in papers (table 7, the evaluation credits the HDR well ahead of similar publications, particularly the World Development Report. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 6 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> agenda 
The <nulltag> office </nulltag> <nulltag> seeks </nulltag> to nurture and sustain an organizational culture committed to ethics and accountability, with the aim of enhancing both the credibility and the effectiveness of the United Nations. 
This function serves to prevent, mitigate and resolve <nulltag> actual </nulltag> or perceived conflicts of interest, and in so doing enhances the integrity of UNOPS and its personnel. 
The <nulltag> Council </nulltag> has been interested in this project since 1982, <nulltag> following </nulltag> the decision taken by the Governments of Morocco and Spain within the framework of a bilateral agreement on cooperation adopted on 24 October 1980 for the joint study of the feasibility of the project. 
15. <nulltag> On-site </nulltag> inspections are provided for in the Treaty as a final verification measure. 
The radionuclide station in Ussuriysk, Russia, <nulltag> reported </nulltag> a similar detection at a lower level. 
5. The Permanent Forum <nulltag> highlights </nulltag> the unprincipled positions and actions of States that undermine indigenous peoples' human rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and that such conduct prejudices indigenous peoples globally and serves to weaken the international human rights system. 
25. Welcomes in this context the <nulltag> continued </nulltag> progress in the development of the Afghan National Army and its improved ability to plan and undertake operations, and encourages sustained training efforts, including through the contribution of trainers, resources and Advisory Teams through the NATO Resolute Support Mission, and advice in developing a sustainable defence planning process as well as assistance in defence reform initiatives; 
3. <nulltag> Decides </nulltag> to <nulltag> extend </nulltag> until 17 March 2016 the mandate of UNAMA, as defined in its resolutions 1662 (2006), 1746 (2007), 1806 (2008), 1868 (2009), 1917 (2010), 1974 (2011), 2041 (2012), 2096 (2013) and 2145 (2014), and paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 below; 
The Committee was also informed that the proposal would enhance the ability of the proposed service to shift from a <nulltag> traditional </nulltag> approach to public information to a proactive approach that leverages an analysis of stakeholder perceptions and strategic forward planning to communicate messages that build support, dispel misconceptions and manage expectations. 
<nulltag> Meanwhile, </nulltag> the United States has not produced highly enriched uranium (HEU) for weapons since 1964 or produced plutonium for weapons since 1988. 
Both dimensions need to be included in the new accountability system and monitored by the Secretariat to ensure impartiality in the light of power imbalances.
Those national and regional processes would then converge at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development which has been mandated by the General Assembly to provide political leadership and review implementation of sustainable development commitments.
Further <nulltag> aerial </nulltag> <nulltag> bombings </nulltag> are alleged to have occurred on 23 March and 6 April in Delieba, Raga County, and on 8 and 9 April in Nyinbouli and Achana in Aweil West County and Mayom Angok in Aweil North County. 
One <nulltag> incident </nulltag> <nulltag> remains </nulltag> to be <nulltag> verified. </nulltag> 
While the <nulltag> global </nulltag> <nulltag> demand </nulltag> for reactor fuel is met through the international nuclear fuel market, establishing additional fuel assurance mechanisms, such as international fuel banks, reinforces confidence and diversifies supply. 
25. Expresses its <nulltag> gratitude </nulltag> to the International Organization of la Francophonie for the steps it has taken in recent years to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and dialogue between cultures and civilizations, and encourages the United Nations and the International Organization of la Francophonie to cooperate more closely to ensure full respect for provisions on multilingualism; 
On <nulltag> behalf </nulltag> of the people of Syria, I therefore ask that members of the Security Council work without delay: 
ISIL extremists have killed <nulltag> innocent </nulltag> children, detained women and children, kidnapped medical workers and beheaded those who dared to defend civilians trapped inside the camp. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Assembly 
Determining that the <nulltag> situation </nulltag> in South Sudan continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region, 
<nulltag> Pursuant </nulltag> to rule 15 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received a letter dated 28 May 2015 from the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations stating that Mr. Francisco Martinez Vazquez will represent Spain at the 7453rd meeting of the Security Council, to be held on 29 May 2015. 
According to one <nulltag> speaker, </nulltag> <nulltag> non-permanent </nulltag> members had sought such an arrangement a decade previously. 
The practice of <nulltag> political </nulltag> coordinators <nulltag> meeting </nulltag> regularly as a group was well established, as were relations among permanent representatives. 
The DPRK Government is of the view that the Security Council should <nulltag> consider </nulltag> the issue of the US-south Korea joint military exercises as a root cause of the vicious cycle of aggravating the situation on the Korean Peninsula as well as a grave threat to the maintenance of international peace and security. 
These US-south Korea <nulltag> joint </nulltag> military exercises were the real nuclear war games of aggression which <nulltag> mobilized </nulltag> all kinds of the latest strategic nuclear strike means with the purpose of occupying Pyongyang, the capital of the DPRK, in order to remove the leadership of the DPRK. 
<nulltag> Indeed, </nulltag> it is surprising that the only reports of insurgency concern four districts in the province of Bujumbura Mairie: Musaga, in the commune of Muha, Cibitoke and Ngagara, in the commune of Ntahangwa, and Nyakabiga, in the commune of Mukaza. 
I ask the competent <nulltag> judicial </nulltag> authorities to treat this as an urgent matter so that the people of Burundi and the international community may know the truth and so that the guilty parties, once identified, may be punished in accordance with the law. 
1. The Assembly is invited to note that Vishnu Dutt Sharma (India) has resigned from the Finance Committee <nulltag> effective </nulltag> 6 February 2015.

Welcoming the <nulltag> recent </nulltag> <nulltag> reports </nulltag> of the Joint Programme, and taking note of new data and analyses contained therein, which provide compelling evidence for accelerated investment and action in the next five years, based on regional variations, to enable countries to end the HIV and AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030, 
3. Stresses the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the programmatic coherence of the Joint Programme to continue to leverage the comparative advantages of diverse United Nations bodies and partners in strengthening a multisectoral response to HIV and AIDS; 
Pursuant to rule 15 of the <nulltag> provisional </nulltag> rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Secretary-General wishes to report that he has received a letter dated 27 May 2015 from the General Services Officer of the Permanent Mission of the United States of America to the United Nations stating that Mr. Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security, will represent the United States of America at the 7453rd meeting of the Security Council, to be held on 29 May 2015.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> The more <nulltag> limited </nulltag> <nulltag> scope </nulltag> of the work of the office no longer warrants leadership at the P-5 level. 
<nulltag> Sixty-ninth </nulltag> <nulltag> session </nulltag> 
2. On 13 <nulltag> November </nulltag> 2014, the President of Brazil <nulltag> signed </nulltag> Decree No. 8.351, which incorporates resolution 2140 (2014) into the national legislation. 
<nulltag> Objective </nulltag> of the Organization: To strengthen regional cooperation and integration in line with the development priorities of the East and North-East Asian subregion in order to accelerate progress towards attainment of internationally agreed development goals and to achieve inclusive and sustainable development 
The two <nulltag> events </nulltag> prompted solid engagement by and synergy between the statistical and geospatial communities. 
In addition to the rations that a <nulltag> "resistance" </nulltag> fighter receives, he <nulltag> gets </nulltag> three cans, on which are written the contents as well as their nutritional value. 
<nulltag> Hizbullah </nulltag> has amassed over 100,000 missiles and rockets in a blatant violation of resolution 1701 (2006). 
17.33 The independent Evaluation Office prepares and <nulltag> implements </nulltag> the evaluation policy and strategy of UN-Women. 
Also in 2014, the <nulltag> Palestine </nulltag> Liberation Organization and Hamas <nulltag> reached </nulltag> a deal to end their <nulltag> political </nulltag> division since 2007 and form a national consensus government, thus putting Gaza and the Palestinian-controlled areas in the West Bank under a single administration. 
The <nulltag> annual </nulltag> report for 2014 of the procurement review body, which was <nulltag> published </nulltag> on 9 March, cited 537 cases of violation of the law, including irregularities in bid evaluations, decisions on bid winners, tender dossiers and technical requirements, as well as unequal treatment of bidders. 
The Committee expects that all efforts will be made to prevent the recurrence of such delays in the renewal or rebidding of air charter contracts for peacekeeping operations that might cause material loss to the Organization.

In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> the Secretariat <nulltag> remains </nulltag> <nulltag> ready </nulltag> to continue discussions with the Government of Iraq, and I will apprise the Security Council of the outcome of the continued efforts of the Secretariat. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) 
The <nulltag> review </nulltag> provides recommendations on how to improve the current evaluation policy to meet the required standards of independence, credibility and relevance of evaluation outcomes. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> agenda </nulltag> for the 7434th meeting of the Security Council 
<nulltag> UN-Habitat </nulltag> has also contributed significantly to the discussion on post-2015 sustainable development goals by providing inputs to the proposed goal on energy, under the umbrella of the UN-Energy family. 
While the Organization is fully committed to the <nulltag> successful </nulltag> implementation of Umoja, a deeper understanding will be required of how Umoja will change the ways departments and offices operate. 
27. Requests the Secretary-General to include information and recommendations regarding the impact of the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons on the protection of civilians in armed conflict as a sub-item in his next reports on the protection of civilians in armed conflict;
Noting that marking and tracing of <nulltag> small </nulltag> arms and light weapons by Member States, particularly countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, can serve to detect violations of applicable arms embargoes and identify weaknesses in stockpile management, 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Representative </nulltag> 
The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has always pursued a policy of friendship and <nulltag> good </nulltag> neighbourliness towards all its neighbouring countries and, in this context, once again expresses its readiness to engage in bilateral talks with the United Arab Emirates with a view to continuing to strengthen bilateral relations and removing any misunderstanding that may exist between the two countries. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 2011, the 1540 <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> and its Expert Group <nulltag> visited </nulltag> the United States and were briefed on U.S. initiatives to implement UNSCR1540. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia <nulltag> condemns </nulltag> the signing of the socalled "treaty", which is directed against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and, as in the case of Georgia's Abkhazia region -- constitutes a factual annexation of the occupied Tskhinvali region of Georgia. 
We <nulltag> commit </nulltag> ourselves to <nulltag> holistic </nulltag> and comprehensive <nulltag> approaches </nulltag> to countering crime, violence, corruption and terrorism in all their forms and manifestations, and to ensuring that those responses are implemented in a coordinated and coherent way, along with broader programmes or measures for social and economic development, poverty eradication, respect for cultural diversity, social peace and social inclusion. 
7427th meeting, <nulltag> held </nulltag> on 14 <nulltag> April </nulltag> 2015.

Noting the <nulltag> adoption </nulltag> on 9 May 2014 by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean at its thirty-fifth session, held in Lima from 5 to 9 May 2014, of resolution 682 (XXXV), entitled "Establishment of the Regional Conference on Social Development in Latin America and the Caribbean", 
<nulltag> Considering </nulltag> also the key role played by the Commission in the region in recent years in facilitating and encouraging dialogue among representatives of the countries of the region, and thus in promoting the consolidation of institutions devoted to social development and to policies and regulatory frameworks for such activities, 
<nulltag> Considering </nulltag> the <nulltag> letter </nulltag> of 17 April 2015 from 14 Senators addressed to the President of the Constitutional Court and received by the Registry of the Court on 28 April 2015, whereby application was made to this Court seeking interpretation of articles 96 and 302 of the Constitution of 18 March 2005; 
And anyone who would <nulltag> violate </nulltag> the main constitutional principles of the Agreement cannot claim to respect the Constitution; 
The <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> prisoner Sidqi al-Maqt, who has been detained for several weeks by the Israeli occupying forces without any justification, is being subjected to various forms of savagery at the hands of the occupiers, including torture, cruel treatment and the denial of rights that are guaranteed under international law, the International Bill of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions.

15.43 The secretariat of the Governing Council will <nulltag> coordinate </nulltag> and facilitate the meetings of intergovernmental bodies, ensuring that organizational units submit documents for circulation to those bodies by the agreed deadlines and that the organization implements decisions of the intergovernmental bodies on time, including resolutions of the Governing Council. 
On the other <nulltag> hand, </nulltag> armed conflict can also drive women to take on new roles either as combatants or as advocates of the prevention of armed violence. 
The entry into force in December 2014 of the Arms Trade Treaty, which <nulltag> includes </nulltag> small arms and light weapons in its scope and contains provisions on ammunition, further raised the level of attention and scrutiny given to controls over small arms and light weapons. 
<nulltag> However, </nulltag> the Committee remains <nulltag> concerned </nulltag> that there may be <nulltag> potential </nulltag> conflicts of interest because UNDP undertakes some of the administrative functions for UN-Women through other service level agreements, such as for information and communications technology systems and the administration of payroll, benefits and entitlements. 
The <nulltag> present </nulltag> report is <nulltag> made </nulltag> available to the <nulltag> Executive </nulltag> Board, and upon request, the Chair presents the report to the Board. 
During the first <nulltag> day </nulltag> of the humanitarian ceasefire, on 13 May 2015, at 10 a.m. (local time), Houthi militias fired a number of projectiles at the city of Najran and the city of Jazan in Saudi Arabia. 
The Coalition's exercise of restraint, commitment to the humanitarian ceasefire and coordination and cooperation with the relevant United Nations agencies ensured the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to the Yemeni people.
Resource requirements (before <nulltag> recosting): </nulltag> $8,101,400 
<nulltag> Police </nulltag> and <nulltag> judicial </nulltag> officers are <nulltag> requested </nulltag> to make every effort to identify those responsible and bring them to justice. 
2. The <nulltag> residents </nulltag> of <nulltag> certain </nulltag> neighbourhoods in the capital representing insurgent strongholds have been held hostage and deprived of their most basic rights, namely, to go about their daily business and seek treatment. 
Noting the <nulltag> need </nulltag> for funding of expenses related to investigations or prosecutions of the International Criminal Court, including in connection with situations referred to the Court by the Security Council, 
9. Calls upon States parties to the Rome Statute that have not yet done so to adopt national legislation to implement obligations emanating from the Rome Statute and to cooperate with the International Criminal Court in the exercise of its functions, and recalls the provision of technical assistance by States parties in this respect;
10. <nulltag> Notes </nulltag> with concern the <nulltag> higher-than-budgeted </nulltag> amount awarded for the architectural and engineering consultancy services as well as the construction contracts, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to make every effort to seek efficiencies throughout the implementation of the project and to report thereon in the context of future progress reports;

For example, a close <nulltag> partnership </nulltag> has been <nulltag> developed </nulltag> between MINUSMA and the European Union delegation in Mali, which provided equipment and supported the refurbishment of a court in Timbuktu. 
<nulltag> Nevertheless, </nulltag> the potential for <nulltag> closer </nulltag> trilateral engagement and cooperation among the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union has yet to be fully explored and exploited. 
The transfer of knowledge and responsibilities from the Umoja team to the corresponding organizational areas within the Secretariat as part of mainstreaming will <nulltag> continue </nulltag> and jointly managed by the process owners and the Chief Information Technology Officer. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
The <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> <nulltag> regulations </nulltag> will substantially harmonize <nulltag> Canadian </nulltag> classification and hazard communication in respect of workplace chemicals with those of the United States and other countries that have already implemented the Globally Harmonized System. 
28. Direct technical <nulltag> advice </nulltag> and expertise have been provided to stakeholders by some Member States and by the secretariat. 
I have the <nulltag> honour </nulltag> to <nulltag> transmit </nulltag> herewith the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia, dated 5 May 2015, regarding the death of <nulltag> 12-year-old </nulltag> Irakli Tsaava, a resident of the Russian-occupied Georgian region of Abkhazia (see annex).

The Government of Rwanda cited the peer-to-peer model used by YouthStart partner Umutanguha Finance Ltd. (Umutanguha) as a <nulltag> best </nulltag> practice for delivery channels in its recently launched national financial literacy strategy; 
I have the honour to forward to you a <nulltag> concept </nulltag> note for the Security Council ministerial briefing on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts (foreign terrorist fighters), which will be held on 29 May 2015 (see annex). 
Continuing <nulltag> threat </nulltag> of foreign terrorist fighters 
In order to <nulltag> set </nulltag> the record straight, I would like to bring once again the <nulltag> following </nulltag> facts to your kind attention.

Such acts are having adverse effect on prospects for achieving the universality of the Treaty by sending a wrong message that being a non-party to the Treaty is more privileged than being a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty.

With <nulltag> regard </nulltag> to whether there was or should be a model scale of priority to <nulltag> determine </nulltag> whether some issues or uses should take precedence over others, or whether the scale could be adapted to suit each case or circumstance, Mr. Becker-Weinberg noted that that depended on how marine spatial planning was perceived by individual States. 
In the <nulltag> case </nulltag> of the parties to the Nauru Agreement, he <nulltag> stressed </nulltag> that only those countries that supported arrangements to shift rights to <nulltag> coastal </nulltag> States would enjoy the benefits of access to the resources of the countries that were parties to the Nauru Agreement.

In this <nulltag> case, </nulltag> Russia should also seek the opinion of many other European countries to which after the Second World War the Soviet Union had exported a totalitarian regime and where it had brutally suppressed any attempts at democratic change, as what happened in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and many other capitals of the so-called "socialist camp". 
Just in the same <nulltag> way </nulltag> that the Soviet Union had divided Europe into <nulltag> ideological </nulltag> camps after the Second World War, contemporary Russia tries to divide the continent into spheres of influence and to conserve dictator regimes by creating and supporting "frozen" conflicts.

But the United States did not <nulltag> roll </nulltag> back its inveterate hostile policy towards the <nulltag> Democratic </nulltag> People's Republic of Korea and has missed all the opportunities. 
The United States has already been <nulltag> disqualified </nulltag> to talk about dialogue and the <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> issue owing to the anachronistic moves to stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
These "elections" <nulltag> constitute </nulltag> a clear violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the norms and principles of international law and, therefore, have no legal effect whatsoever.

Accordingly, the present <nulltag> report </nulltag> aims at providing an overview of progress in implementing the Action Plan, including of entity-specific remedial action plans, lessons learned and next steps, and in mainstreaming gender equality in common programming processes of the United Nations at the country level, including through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and other planning frameworks.

Switzerland has <nulltag> played </nulltag> an active role, both in terms of institutional strengthening and in the review process of the Human Rights Council; it has, moreover, been a key driver in the establishment of the Office of the President of the Human Rights Council. 
For example, the <nulltag> Global </nulltag> Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities includes multi-stakeholder partnerships in nutrients, wastewater management and marine litter which consider the economic and social issues in addition to the environmental aspects. 
115. The science-policy interface must also be woven into initiatives so as to not only enable an understanding of the possibilities afforded by oceans, but also to ensure informed decisions and the proper monitoring of the resultant actions (see paras. 129-132).
He clearly tries to excuse the nuclear <nulltag> attacks </nulltag> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and cruelly refers to the resulting enormous loss of human lives as a trivial matter. 
Despite the previous deceitful manoeuvres, the official <nulltag> points </nulltag> to nuclear warheads this regime has in its possession. 
Collective and concrete action is <nulltag> needed </nulltag> to hasten the end of this illegitimate, immoral and inhumane occupation and the realization of Palestinian freedom. 
<nulltag> Recently, </nulltag> 320 Palestinians were temporarily forced to leave their homes and livestock owing to these activities, which, in the past, have led to the destruction of <nulltag> Palestinian </nulltag> land and property in the area, including the burning of 3,000 dunums of crops after a fire caused by military drills on 28 April and the burning of 5,000 dunums of land on 4 May owing to heavy military fire. 
The <nulltag> effectiveness </nulltag> of the remedy is also <nulltag> limited </nulltag> in practice for the authors, given that there are seven district councils in Shinyanga alone, which are predominantly <nulltag> male </nulltag> and can exercise their discretion in deciding to amend customary law. 
This is one practical <nulltag> approach </nulltag> which <nulltag> ensures </nulltag> that States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have access to the peaceful uses of civil nuclear energy, while upholding high standards of safety, security and non-proliferation. 
26. The security and safety of our nuclear weapons is <nulltag> given </nulltag> the very highest priority and is entirely consistent with our obligations under non-proliferation agreements. 
Affirm the <nulltag> commitment </nulltag> of all Arab States to participate in the 2012 conference; and

<nulltag> Continuous </nulltag> support for promoting an integrated programme approach 
<nulltag> Likewise, </nulltag> many United Nations agencies have also <nulltag> played </nulltag> an active part in implementing the principle of free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples during the implementation of their programmes in various countries. 
The three <nulltag> members </nulltag> of the Commission who voted against adoption requested that the recommendation be accompanied by a summary of their divergences of opinion, in accordance with rule 46 of the rules of procedure of the Commission. 
1. During the <nulltag> twentieth </nulltag> <nulltag> session </nulltag> of the International Seabed Authority in 2014, the Legal and Technical Commission of the Authority drew to the attention of the Council the fact that seven contracts (see annex I) for exploration for polymetallic nodules would expire in 2016 and 2017. 
There are <nulltag> limited </nulltag> <nulltag> measures </nulltag> to encourage cooperation among national authorities and with the private sector.

The attached <nulltag> report* </nulltag> <nulltag> summarizes </nulltag> the conversations and meetings I held during my visit, as well as my conclusions. 
The <nulltag> Constitution </nulltag> sets forth <nulltag> individual </nulltag> and social rights and duties, fundamental guarantees and the right to culture, education, health care and social security with a view to building an equitable society without distinction as to creed, race, religion or political affiliation. 
9. Those <nulltag> international </nulltag> <nulltag> conferences </nulltag> <nulltag> demonstrated </nulltag> that the consequences of a nuclear weapon detonation, irrespective of the cause, for humanity would include death, destruction and displacement as well as profound and long-term damage to human health, the environment, climate and socioeconomic development. 
Although <nulltag> knowledge </nulltag> of the consequences and risks is not <nulltag> new </nulltag> -- and indeed was one of the key drivers for the negotiation and agreement of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- the compelling body of evidence that has been <nulltag> presented </nulltag> to the international community since the last Review Conference in 2010 has served to heighten awareness of the scale and extent of the consequences and thus the risks that will persist until nuclear weapons are eliminated. 
The Non-Proliferation Treaty review process was <nulltag> designed </nulltag> to mitigate the discriminatory nature of the Treaty that recognizes five nuclear-weapon States as possessing nuclear weapons.

Nairobi, 14-16 April 2015
I <nulltag> urge </nulltag> the two parties to build on the existing momentum and agree to the holding of a second meeting of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee as soon as possible following the holding of the traditional leaders' dialogue, to address the implementation of their past decisions, including the concrete steps required to ensure that Abyei is maintained as a weapons-free zone. 
19. <nulltag> Following </nulltag> the agreement by the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee to hold a traditional leaders' dialogue at the end of April, the meeting was postponed to the second week of May owing to the participation of the Co-Chair for the Sudan in the general elections in his country, where he stood as a member of parliament in Western Kordofan.

1. Developing economic cooperation among Azerbaijani, Turkish and Turkmen enterprises and companies.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs stated that the agreements reached at the <nulltag> highest </nulltag> level created a firm foundation for further expansion of trilateral ties in the different fields of political, energy, trade and economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation. 
36. <nulltag> Morocco </nulltag> <nulltag> remains </nulltag> convinced of the effectiveness of the approach set out in article VII of the NPT aimed at creation of <nulltag> nuclear-weapon-free </nulltag> zones in all regions of the world, as a useful means to strengthen the regime of nuclear non-proliferation in order to secure the realization of nuclear disarmament and the consolidation of peace and security regionally and internationally. 
We now know incontrovertibly that Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) has been violated and we know which party is to blame: the <nulltag> Syrian </nulltag> regime. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> is high <nulltag> time </nulltag> that the will of the Security Council was enforced. 
Rapporteurs: Mr. Chandra Bhushan
We should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annexes <nulltag> circulated </nulltag> as a document of the seventieth session of the General Assembly. 
20. It is in that <nulltag> context </nulltag> that the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> believes that it is unnecessary to establish a senior-level working group to review, in consultation with other departments, the OHCHR strategic planning process and to report thereon to the General Assembly. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> also <nulltag> affirms </nulltag> that, through the Committee for Programme and Coordination, there is oversight of programme matters.

On 3 May 2015, the Republic of Armenia <nulltag> conducted </nulltag> the <nulltag> so-called </nulltag> "elections" to the "parliament" of the puppet separatist regime that it had established in the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania <nulltag> stated </nulltag> on 4 May 2015 that it "considers illegitimate the legal framework under which have been organized the so-called `parliamentary elections' on 3 May 2015 in the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh", and reiterated its "consistently asserted principled position of non-recognition of the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh region".

<nulltag>  </nulltag> session 
As long as this <nulltag> situation </nulltag> continues, there will be <nulltag> little </nulltag> fiscal space for locally driven development, or even for basic service delivery. 
<nulltag> Syria </nulltag> calls on the Security Council to condemn this act of terrorism and take tangible, <nulltag> stern </nulltag> measures against the terrorist groups and those States that support and sponsor them, in accordance with its relevant resolutions, in particular resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) and 2199 (2015). 
The Syrian Arab Republic <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> that this <nulltag> cowardly </nulltag> act of terrorism, which was aimed at innocent civilians, will not succeed in shaking the unity of the Syrian people in all its components, a trait that has characterized that people throughout its long history. 
With <nulltag> respect </nulltag> to the future of New Caledonia, the President of the Republic reminded elected officials that a referendum among the people of New Caledonia on the question of the Territory's assumption of full sovereignty would take place on a date chosen by the Congress or, if the Congress did not choose a date, by 2018 at the latest.

In 2013, young people aged 15-24 accounted for 31 per cent of new HIV infections globally, with 57 per cent of those new infections in this age group occurring among adolescent girls and young women [1].
While <nulltag> actual </nulltag> international <nulltag> disbursements </nulltag> <nulltag> rose </nulltag> marginally in 2013, commitments to new funding from traditional funding sources decreased by 3 per cent [18] and there remains a significant gap between the resources needed and the investment made in AIDS resources. 
<nulltag> Considering </nulltag> the important long-term <nulltag> contribution </nulltag> of Ukraine to the maintenance of international peace and stability, including through participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operations, 
3. Stresses the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the <nulltag> oversight </nulltag> functions of the Unit in identifying concrete managerial, administrative and programming questions within the participating organizations and providing the General Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations to improve and strengthen the governance of the United Nations as a whole;

One <nulltag> C-160 </nulltag> Turkish military aircraft <nulltag> infringed </nulltag> international air traffic regulations by entering the Nicosia FIR without diplomatic permit or contacting the Nicosia ACC. 
45. In the <nulltag> framework </nulltag> of the follow-up to the fourth World Conference on Women and to the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century", the regional commissions held regional reviews, in partnership and collaboration with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. 
At the same <nulltag> time </nulltag> the unutilized balances under this category will be transferred to the Special Account of Voluntary Contributions for Core Activities. 
Operations of the MCIF will be <nulltag> reviewed </nulltag> by the policymaking organs in the framework of the established programme and budgets approval process to determine, inter alia, the adequacy of the fund balance and the level of allocations required within the <nulltag> regular </nulltag> budget after considering such factors as extrabudgetary contributions received or pledged for items covered by the Fund, rate of implementation, and adjustments to the schedule of capital investments due to changes in circumstances or prioritization.

Draft resolution submitted by the President of the General Assembly
2. The situation <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> Iraq 
22. The <nulltag> issue </nulltag> of verification lies at the heart of the disarmament and arms control process and in South Africa's view <nulltag> forms </nulltag> a critical element of that process. 
South Africa has worked on a <nulltag> continuous </nulltag> basis, both in its national capacity and in the context of the political, regional and other groupings in which it participates, to promote the CTBT in general and also to promote its entry into force through the early signature and ratification of the Treaty, especially by those States whose ratification are required for its entry into force. 
The massacres and the crimes against humanity <nulltag> committed </nulltag> by <nulltag> armed </nulltag> terrorist groups, the latest of which was the Mab`ujah massacre, makes it imperative for, indeed, incumbent on, peace-loving States to take punitive measures against those States that support and fund the indiscriminate terrorism that has been directed against Syria and its people for more than four years. 
The section also <nulltag> contains </nulltag> analyses of some of the economic challenges faced in the region, as well as a discussion of some key policy options. 
The expansion took place in nearly all those economies, but growth was driven mainly by mineral resource production in Papua New Guinea, which accounts for close to 60 per cent of the output of those economies.
The <nulltag> regime's </nulltag> actions are now on the way to <nulltag> making </nulltag> Syria into a <nulltag> failed </nulltag> State, posing a threat to the security and stability of the region and of the world as a whole. 
Contributions to the PUI from the United States and other <nulltag> international </nulltag> donors have <nulltag> provided </nulltag> the IAEA with additional flexibility and resources to support high priority IAEA Member State projects and to respond to unforeseen challenges, sometimes on short notice. 
The <nulltag> International </nulltag> Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is an <nulltag> international </nulltag> judicial body <nulltag> established </nulltag> by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to adjudicate disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention.

The Conference of Ministers, inter alia, <nulltag> endorsed </nulltag> the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade <nulltag> 2014-2024 </nulltag> and requested the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa to mainstream the Vienna Programme of Action into the programme of work of the Commission, as appropriate and within its mandate, and to submit analytical reports on the implementation of the Programme of Action, as called for in its paragraph 75. 
The United Nations <nulltag> continues </nulltag> to prioritize and strengthen the <nulltag> timely </nulltag> recruitment and deployment of skilled and experienced humanitarian staff, while remaining committed to the need for diversity in geographical representation and gender balance. 
<nulltag> UNDP </nulltag> has <nulltag> developed </nulltag> a <nulltag> new </nulltag> contract management policy which is in the final stages of review and consultation before it is launched and implemented across the organization.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme 
For the biennium <nulltag> 2016-2017, </nulltag> these consolidated <nulltag> resources </nulltag> are <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> in the amount of $446,158,100 before recosting, reflecting a net decrease of $989,900 (0.2 per cent) compared with the appropriation for the biennium 2014-2015. 
On <nulltag> instructions </nulltag> from my Government, I transmit to you herewith the points that were agreed on at the second Moscow consultative meeting in relation to the first agenda item proposed by the meeting's facilitator, which concerns the assessment of the current situation in Syria (see annex). 
<nulltag> Miscellaneous </nulltag> income 
The <nulltag> international </nulltag> community has consistently deplored, in the strongest terms, the use of military force against Azerbaijan and the resulting occupation of its territories. 
In the <nulltag> coming </nulltag> months, the <nulltag> reports </nulltag> will produce a <nulltag> detailed </nulltag> road map to assist in the building of capacity to resist the threat of foreign terrorist fighters. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
This <nulltag> process </nulltag> has involved, among other tasks, searching for and reviewing a <nulltag> significant </nulltag> number of documents for disclosure purposes, as well as preparing two major submissions on related issues at the order of the Trial Chamber. 
It is <nulltag> estimated </nulltag> that the <nulltag> judgement </nulltag> could be rendered in the last quarter of 2015, unless unforeseen circumstances arise. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Adoption of the agenda and other <nulltag> organizational </nulltag> matters. 
1. The provisional agenda for the forty-ninth session of the Commission on Population and Development set out below has been prepared on the basis of existing legislative authority, in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1894 (LVII).
<nulltag> Final </nulltag> disposition of the assets of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad 
To be <nulltag> held </nulltag> on <nulltag> Thursday, </nulltag> 26 March 2015, at 3 p.m. 
<nulltag> Report </nulltag> of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on its 2013 and 2014 sessions 
In <nulltag> recent </nulltag> months, the Syrian Government has <nulltag> allowed </nulltag> terrorists to use its territory as a launching base to plant roadside bombs, fire rockets into Israel and open fire on Israel Defense Forces inside Israel. 
The challenge of skill was about how to deal effectively with such established goals and how to mobilize the necessary resources.
There was a <nulltag> call </nulltag> to strengthen the engagement of civil society and young people in the post-2015 development agenda. 
1. Accepts the financial report and <nulltag> audited </nulltag> financial statements of the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014;1 
<nulltag> Protect </nulltag> activities of the Task Force from undue influence by vested interests 
However, completion rates, especially for girls and young women, <nulltag> remain </nulltag> low on average, at 37 per cent, and highly skewed towards higher-income urban populations. 
The <nulltag> number </nulltag> of children <nulltag> enrolled </nulltag> in school has increased from 62 million in 1990 to 149 million in 2012 but resources have failed to keep up with this increase (ECA and others, 2014). 
Provisional agenda of the Assembly
The sustainable <nulltag> management </nulltag> of all types of forests is vital to poverty eradication, economic growth and decent employment, food security and nutrition, gender equality, governance, health, water quality and supply, energy production, climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, watershed protection and disaster risk reduction. 
3. In <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with rule 3 of the rules of procedure, the Conference, on the proposal of the President, <nulltag> appointed </nulltag> the following countries as members of the Credentials Committee: Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Kyrgyzstan, Norway and Viet Nam. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> and information concerning action taken pursuant to judgments and orders of the Tribunal 
33. The IAEA should <nulltag> observe </nulltag> the principles set forth in its Statute and maintain the balanced development of activities to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation and to peacefully use nuclear energy. 
There are <nulltag> international </nulltag> <nulltag> standards </nulltag> for the treatment of children, and Palestinian children are no exception. 
<nulltag> Switzerland </nulltag> is of the view that such an instrument should be of a <nulltag> multilateral </nulltag> character, non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable and should cover the future production and existing stocks of fissile material. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> therefore is a State party to all international conventions in the field of nuclear safety. 
This overexpenditure was <nulltag> due </nulltag> mainly to the fact that two judges whose term ended in September 2014 continued to sit in case No. 21, in accordance with the Rules of the Tribunal from October 2014 until December 2014. 
In <nulltag> Liberia, </nulltag> on behalf of the Liberia configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission, my discussions with the Government, national stakeholders and international partners focused on how the Commission can best support the post-Ebola recovery process and the preparation for the drawdown of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). 
1. The <nulltag> Treaty </nulltag> on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was foreseen as a way to prevent proliferation, both horizontally and vertically, and bring about the total elimination of nuclear weapons while protecting the inalienable right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Adoption </nulltag> of the agenda and organization of work. 
5. Discussion on the theme "Indigenous peoples: conflict, peace and resolution".
7. This system is further <nulltag> weakened </nulltag> by doctrines of deterrence whereby the <nulltag> nuclear-weapon </nulltag> States have granted themselves the right to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States in certain circumstances. 
With regard to the safeguards embodied in the framework of protocols to nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties, these suffer from certain shortcomings and are subject to the same conditions as safeguards granted in the framework of Resolution No. 984.
3. Political dialogue between the Government and Front <nulltag> populaire </nulltag> ivoirien (FPI), the former ruling party, resumed on 29 December, within the context of the permanent framework for dialogue. 
<nulltag> FRCI </nulltag> <nulltag> continued </nulltag> to face <nulltag> institutional </nulltag> gaps in terms of training, discipline and low public confidence. 
2. One non-member State, the Holy See, has also <nulltag> offered </nulltag> scholarships. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Committee 
7. <nulltag> Ultimately, </nulltag> it is difficult to <nulltag> understand </nulltag> how any disarmament, arms control and regional security issues can be addressed without any direct dialogue between the regional States, as the Group of Arab States suggests. 
Progress on the file of missing Kuwaiti persons and property is central to the full normalization of relations between the two countries and will have far-reaching implications on other aspects of mutual interest.
8. On 11 and 12 <nulltag> March, </nulltag> the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <nulltag> published </nulltag> an announcement in local daily newspapers in an attempt to identify witnesses with knowledge of missing Kuwaiti and third-country nationals and missing Kuwaiti property. 
9. The decision to use <nulltag> nuclear </nulltag> energy for peaceful purposes is within the sovereign domain of each State party. 
1. <nulltag> Takes </nulltag> note of the note by the Secretary-General on the <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> organization of work of the third International Conference on Financing for Development; 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> we have publicly <nulltag> welcomed </nulltag> the proposals formulated by President Obama in June 2013 to further deepen the reductions and to move beyond the <nulltag> current </nulltag> posture. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Election of officers. 
<nulltag> Following </nulltag> the completion of each job fair "after action reviews" will be carried out to highlight lessons learned and propose recommendations for future activities that would improve the services provided to staff. 
<nulltag> Temporary </nulltag> <nulltag> positions </nulltag> 
Moreover, the Organization <nulltag> "urges </nulltag> the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community to exert pressure on Israel to renounce possession of its nuclear weapons, to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons without further delay and any conditions, to place promptly all its unsafeguarded nuclear facilities under IAEA full-scope safeguards". 
11. <nulltag> Consideration, </nulltag> with a view to approval, of applications for approval of plans of work for exploration in the Area. 
4. <nulltag> Election </nulltag> of the Vice-Presidents.

South America's commodity exporters, particularly oil exporters, have <nulltag> experienced </nulltag> <nulltag> significant </nulltag> changes in the terms of trade and, consequently, in their external accounts, in addition to weaker investment prospects.

I have the honour to submit herewith a press release regarding the ongoing electoral process in Burundi (see annex).
The <nulltag> Ministry </nulltag> of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation calls on the international community, which played a key role in the negotiations that enabled Burundians to restore peace and democracy after they were deprived of their leader in the bloody 1993 coup d'état against President Melchior Ndadaye, to continue to support the Government, which represents the popular will, and to provide it with all necessary assistance for the success of the elections to be held between May and August 2015. 
This will <nulltag> make </nulltag> it <nulltag> possible </nulltag> to document <nulltag> evidence </nulltag> of remarkable courage in circumstances that meet the criteria established under resolution 2154 (2014) and open up the possibility of considering additional worthy candidates to be honoured for exceptional courage, as exemplified by the extraordinary bravery of Captain Mbaye Diagne. 
Commissioning analytical papers and in-house research on rethinking human development

22. Since the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, significant progress has been <nulltag> made </nulltag> by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in the implementation of its mandate to facilitate ratification processes. 
<nulltag> On-site </nulltag> <nulltag> inspections </nulltag> 
<nulltag> Consistent </nulltag> with both the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the Declaration, States, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, should <nulltag> develop </nulltag> legislation and mechanisms at the national level to ensure that laws are consistent with the Declaration. 
Expressing also <nulltag> concern </nulltag> with the <nulltag> serious </nulltag> threat that anti-personnel mines, remnants of war and improvised explosive devices pose to the civilian population, and stressing the need to refrain from the use of weapons and devices prohibited by international law, 
34. Welcomes the continued efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in empowering the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics-led implementation of the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, including through the JCMB's Counter Narcotics Monitoring Mechanism;
<nulltag>  </nulltag> also <nulltag> indicates </nulltag> that these <nulltag> costs </nulltag> were previously budgeted under the support account. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> II </nulltag> Division: renaming of the Great Lakes Integrated Operational Team to the Central Africa Integrated Operational Team 
<nulltag> Toward </nulltag> that end, we welcome the removal and destruction of more than 98 per cent of Syria's declared <nulltag> chemical </nulltag> weapons stockpile which was made possible by the extraordinary effort of the international community and the UN-OPCW Joint Mission. 
This revised <nulltag> assurance </nulltag> underscores the important security benefits of adhering to and fully complying with the NPT. 
However, the GNI per capita would <nulltag> remain </nulltag> far above the graduation threshold even if oil prices remained low. 
Tensions <nulltag> increased </nulltag> between SPLA and internally displaced persons at the UNMISS protection site on 10 March, after SPLA shot two displaced persons grazing cattle outside the protection site, killing one of them, and stole 25 cattle. 
4.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Review </nulltag> Conference could: 
All the obligations under the Treaty represent an integral package of commitments, the implementation of which, along with relevant decisions adopted at Review Conferences, would collectively contribute to its effectiveness and the realization of its objectives.
6. As with each of the other main <nulltag> pillars </nulltag> of the Treaty, the implementation of commitments in the field of nuclear disarmament had to be linked to progress in other more overarching goals, namely treaty universality, a crucial objective to which the decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty was linked. 
17. Notes with satisfaction the development of collaboration between the United Nations and the International Organization of la Francophonie in electoral monitoring and assistance, and encourages the strengthening of cooperation between the two organizations in that area;
Comprehensive <nulltag> action </nulltag> by the Security Council is <nulltag> needed </nulltag> to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians at the hands of extremists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and end the indiscriminate aerial bombardment by Assad's forces in besieged areas across Syria. 
The letter evidently <nulltag> testifies </nulltag> to Armenia's policy of denial of its responsibility for and diverting the attention of the international community from atrocious crimes it has committed against civilians in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, including the Khojaly massacre.

The <nulltag> recent </nulltag> underwater test-fire by the DPRK of a ballistic missile from a strategic submarine is a legitimate measure of a sovereign State to bolster up its self-defence capability against the provocative military manoeuvres of the United States. 
This clearly shows the <nulltag> aggressive </nulltag> nature of the US-south Korea joint military exercises against the DPRK.

The Committee further recalls its general recommendation No. 19, which has clearly placed violence against women within the ambit of discrimination against women by stating that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination against women and includes acts that inflict physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty.
She is therefore of the <nulltag> view </nulltag> that the Danish Immigration Service has admitted that the events are factual, even though the State party considers them irrelevant and not sufficient to justify granting asylum. 
In this regard, the resolution calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to support the process of nuclear disarmament and to work expeditiously for the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals.
Among other significant <nulltag> achievements </nulltag> of that process was the adoption in 2000 of the 13 practical steps leading to nuclear disarmament and of the action plan of the 2010 Review Conference, which reaffirmed and deepened those commitments. 
The <nulltag> fundamental </nulltag> <nulltag> demands </nulltag> of the Georgian side were <nulltag> rejected </nulltag> by some participants and, as a result, they walked out at the end of the round.

As leader of the group, al-Houthi has repeatedly <nulltag> threatened </nulltag> Yemeni authorities with further unrest if they do not respond to his demands and detained President Hadi, Prime Minister, and key cabinet members. 
It is a <nulltag> situation </nulltag> constituting a <nulltag> direct </nulltag> threat to the lives of the nearly 18,000 Palestine refugees who remain in the camp, of the original 160,000 residents. 
Simultaneously, all efforts must be made to secure immediate, sustained and <nulltag> unimpeded </nulltag> humanitarian access and assistance to the camp's residents, as well as to ensure the safe exit of any civilians who seek refuge from the violence in Yarmouk.

In full disregard of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and tantamount to a call for redrawing international borders, the statement runs counter to the spirit of cooperation, mutual understanding and good-neighbourliness and the common future of the countries of the region and their efforts to join the European Union.

There is no reason that one more Syrian should be gassed to death by a brutal dictator intent on exploiting his monopoly of air power to barrel bomb his own people into submission.
Should the Security Council fail to reach the consensus needed to authorize a <nulltag> safe </nulltag> zone, then I urge Member States to act on their own legal and moral authority to save lives in Syria and take the steps necessary to provide protection to our people.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
1. <nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> <nulltag> weapons, </nulltag> as the most horrendous, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever developed, are unique in their destructive power, in the unspeakable human suffering they cause, in the impossibility of controlling their effects in time and space and in the threat they pose to the environment, to future generations and indeed to the very survival of humanity.

And no one else except <nulltag> Russian </nulltag> journalists and diplomats <nulltag> attempted </nulltag> to find a different context in his words -- a context that was not there and could never have been there. 
<nulltag> Re-emphasizing </nulltag> the <nulltag> importance </nulltag> of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire to be able to respond proportionately to threats to the security of all citizens in Côte d'Ivoire and calling on the Government of Côte d'Ivoire to ensure that its security forces remain committed to upholding human rights and applicable international law,

Recent <nulltag> studies </nulltag> and assessments, however, indicate that the flow of foreign terrorist fighters into conflict zones is continuing and that more needs to be done to tackle the phenomenon.

In <nulltag> paragraph </nulltag> 24 of the <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> budget, the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> indicates that the facility in Valencia has reached its maximum capacity and that he has initiated discussions with the host Government to explore options for expanding the current capacity.

As indicated in these letters, in addition to the protection provided by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the Somali National Security Forces, the Council took note of the proposed arrangements for the establishment of a United Nations guard unit that would form part of the <nulltag> overall </nulltag> security concept by providing "inner ring" static protection for UNSOM and UNSOA facilities and installations in Mogadishu.

1. To <nulltag> resolve </nulltag> the <nulltag> crisis </nulltag> in Syria by political means, on the basis of mutual consent and the Geneva principles of 30 June 2012.

Fortunately, the Israel Defense Force <nulltag> disrupted </nulltag> the operation and avoided an escalation that could have further destabilized an already volatile region. 
The members had <nulltag> commended </nulltag> the World Bank Group's commitment to mainstreaming <nulltag> low-carbon </nulltag> development and disaster risk management while maintaining focus on its poverty eradication mandate, and further encouraged efforts and financing to contribute to the success of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December 2015. 
The global economic <nulltag> outlook </nulltag> was uneven and there was no room for complacency.

Every single <nulltag> day, </nulltag> and in countless ways, Palestinian children are victims of Israeli human rights violations, with no child <nulltag> considered </nulltag> too young to be spared the oppression being meted out by the Israeli occupying forces and extremist settlers.

The 2010 <nulltag> Nuclear </nulltag> Posture Review underscores that the United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in <nulltag> extreme </nulltag> circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners, and that it is in the U.S. interest, and that of all other nations, that the now nearly 70-year record of nuclear weapon non-use be extended forever. 
87. The <nulltag> landscape </nulltag> of financing for development has <nulltag> changed </nulltag> significantly over the last two decades.

NPT Parties should <nulltag> support </nulltag> efforts by the <nulltag> international </nulltag> community to address these challenges. 
We also recognize that, to enhance the effectiveness and fairness of such strategies, we should take measures to ensure the contribution of civil society, the private sector and academia, including the network of institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, as well as the media and all other relevant stakeholders, in the development and implementation of crime prevention policies.
We <nulltag> recognize </nulltag> our responsibility to adequately respond to emerging and evolving threats posed by such crimes.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> March </nulltag> 2015 
5. This <nulltag> drift </nulltag> into <nulltag> selective </nulltag> criminality should <nulltag> induce </nulltag> the organizers of the insurrection to reflect on the consequences of acts that for Burundians stir memories of what they lived through in 1994, in virtually the same districts, with the same protagonists, and, oddly enough, the same methods, the only difference being that now they have no hesitation in attacking the forces of law and order when they try to stop their barbarous acts. 
18. <nulltag> Urges </nulltag> all States parties to <nulltag> take </nulltag> the interests, needs for assistance and mandate of the International Criminal Court into account when relevant matters are being discussed in the United Nations, and invites all other States to consider doing the same, as appropriate; 
38. The <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> states that, over the course of the five-year implementation period of the global field support strategy, a new service delivery model has been defined and developed which no longer views each field mission as a stand-alone entity, but which prioritizes functional specialization at each level of the Organization, with different entities operating as part of a single field support system, thereby allowing a greater concentration of expertise and consistent service delivery. 
<nulltag> F. </nulltag> Benefits reporting 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> In the <nulltag> absence </nulltag> of an administrative fee, the processing costs would need to be met from within the administrative budget of the Authority.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> The situation in Liberia (22 January 1991; 2 April 2015). 
It thus appears that there is a <nulltag> need </nulltag> to mobilize a <nulltag> broad </nulltag> range of modalities in most cases, including a combination of voluntary, assessed and bilateral modalities, as appropriate. 
The component will be implemented in <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with the strategy detailed under component 3, Management evaluation component of the administration of justice, of subprogramme 1, Management services, administration of justice and services to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, of programme 25, part A, Management and support services, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2016-2017.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> have the honour to transmit herewith a letter dated 2 April 2015, addressed to you by Mr. Mehmet Dânâ, Representative of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (see annex). 
As noted in our previous letters, such allegations are based on the false and unlawful claim that the sovereignty of the Greek Cypriot administration extends over the whole island, including the territory, national airspace and territorial waters of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
<nulltag>  </nulltag> positions 
<nulltag> Recalling </nulltag> further the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women as it concerns the protection of civilian populations, 
If so, it is my intention to take the <nulltag> necessary </nulltag> steps to increase the strength of the guard unit as soon as possible. 
One <nulltag> GLF-4 </nulltag> Turkish aircraft <nulltag> infringed </nulltag> international air traffic regulations and violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus by entering the Nicosia FIR and the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus without diplomatic permit or contacting the Nicosia ACC, having departed from the illegal airport of Tympou. 
As you are aware, a <nulltag> decision </nulltag> on the proposal of the Secretary-General was not reached in the context of the consideration of the proposed programme budget in the <nulltag> main </nulltag> part of the sixty-eighth session, at which point it was deferred. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> Consideration and adoption of the report of the meeting. 
Member States should consider how to cope with ever increasing demands or <nulltag> specific </nulltag> needs in nuclear Education and Training, worldwide. 
To promote the <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> assistance in the development of the NKM programmes through KM maturity assessment services for nuclear organizations (KMAV for operating organizations, R&D organizations, Regulatory Bodies). 
8. <nulltag> Article </nulltag> 2, paragraph 3, of annex II to the Convention <nulltag> provides </nulltag> that not <nulltag> less </nulltag> than three members of the Commission shall be elected from each geographical region.

The terrorist attack in Bamako on 8 March, as well as the asymmetric attacks against Government forces south of the Niger belt, <nulltag> provided </nulltag> stark reminders that insecurity is not confined to the far north of Mali. 
The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> <nulltag> concerning </nulltag> the Democratic Republic of the Congo (29 May 1997; 26 March 2015) 
Summary of efforts to strengthen <nulltag> national </nulltag> capabilities against illicit trafficking of nuclear material. 
The <nulltag> aim </nulltag> of the proposal was to provide the nuclear-weapon States with a template with which to implement actions 5 and 21. 
The <nulltag> proposed </nulltag> <nulltag> increases </nulltag> are offset in part by the reduction and the discontinuation of the provision for the acquisition and replacement of furniture and equipment and vehicles reflected in the budget for the biennium <nulltag> 2014-2015. </nulltag> 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> 
In this <nulltag> regard, </nulltag> newly emerging types of risk (i.e. relating to cyberattacks aimed at the highly <nulltag> automated </nulltag> nuclear military command infrastructure) could further heighten the threat. 
As <nulltag> such, </nulltag> it is not only a disarmament measure but also a significant contribution to non-proliferation, given that continued emphasis on the importance of weapons on high alert could lead to false perceptions of nuclear weapons as desirable security instruments. 
The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly request the <nulltag> Secretary-General </nulltag> to provide in the relevant performance report a detailed accounting of all the vehicles transferred to UNMEER, including information on the types of vehicles, the originating missions and the asset value, transportation and freight costs, as well as comprehensive information on the donation of the vehicles.

Urge the United Nations Development Group to <nulltag> continue </nulltag> to focus attention on the issue of strengthening capacities and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, taking into account the key messages of the Dialogue, in the planning and implementation of its programme activities and partnership-building; 
12. <nulltag> Reaffirm </nulltag> our commitment to <nulltag> cooperate </nulltag> and engage through multilateral, <nulltag> regional, </nulltag> bilateral and public-private partnership initiatives aiming at exchanging experiences and best practices in the area of effective institutions and capacity development; 
While the issue of the protection of journalists in armed conflict is periodically referred to in open debates on the protection of civilians, specific Security Council outcomes thereon are few and far between.
It <nulltag> recalled </nulltag> that <nulltag> journalists </nulltag> were protected as civilians under international humanitarian law, unless they took action adversely affecting their status as civilians. 
26. The <nulltag> decreased </nulltag> <nulltag> requirements </nulltag> are offset in part by increased requirements, primarily under: 
To align with the <nulltag> Lebanon </nulltag> Crisis Response Plan 2015-2016, which has been endorsed by the Government.

Knowingly and with <nulltag> impunity, </nulltag> <nulltag> Russia </nulltag> <nulltag> continues </nulltag> violating human rights in the occupied territory, terrorizing those who disagree, especially Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, conducting detentions and searches, chasing and detaining civic activists and waging a whole war against independent media and journalists. 
The <nulltag> Security </nulltag> Council <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> that all parties should take <nulltag> concrete </nulltag> steps to agree and implement a consensus-based political solution to Yemen's crisis in accordance with the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the comprehensive National Dialogue conference, and the Peace and National Partnership Agreement and its security annex.

Whereas the <nulltag> proposals </nulltag> <nulltag> put </nulltag> forward were mutually exclusive, as the parties on one side proposed to have the President of the Republic elected by the National Assembly and the Senate, and this proposal was challenged by the proponents of election by direct universal suffrage, which would give the President so elected a strong mandate from the people and broad legitimacy;

13. The Committee notes that the opening, in 2014, of the Regional Office of UNWomen for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in Istanbul, Turkey, completed the implementation of the <nulltag> regional </nulltag> architecture of UN-Women. 
A strong <nulltag> focus </nulltag> on high-impact initiatives will ensure that the proposed growth will likewise be driven by and responsive to the Entity's mandate and strategic plan. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> The <nulltag> Fifth </nulltag> Committee <nulltag> resumed </nulltag> its consideration of the item at its 29th and 34th meetings, on 4 and 27 March 2015. 
Affirming that the efforts of the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of disputes, including through its peacekeeping operations, are indispensable,
The <nulltag> Advisory </nulltag> Committee further <nulltag> stresses </nulltag> the need for <nulltag> cost-effective </nulltag> solutions that maximize savings. 
The relevant <nulltag> paragraphs </nulltag> of the draft procedures and criteria (paras. 4-6) are reproduced in annex I to the present note. 
16. The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> <nulltag> adopted </nulltag> concluding observations on each of the reports considered.

62. The <nulltag> situation </nulltag> between Iran and Iraq (26 September 1980; 31 January 1991). 
Important <nulltag> lessons </nulltag> have been <nulltag> learned </nulltag> from the recent transitions of operations from the African Union to the United Nations in the Central African Republic and Mali, which should be applied to future transitions. 
The component will be implemented in <nulltag> accordance </nulltag> with the strategy detailed under component 4, Services to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, of subprogramme 1, Management services, administration of justice and services to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, of programme 25, part A, Management and support services, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2016-2017.

The proposed reductions will not have an impact on the full and effective implementation of the mandate.
The <nulltag> items </nulltag> involved were <nulltag> "spare </nulltag> parts for combat aircraft", which are covered by paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1929 (2010). 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> II 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> <nulltag> Other </nulltag> <nulltag> matters. </nulltag> 
The Falkland Islands (Malvinas) has a very <nulltag> low </nulltag> rate of unemployment, which was <nulltag> recorded </nulltag> as less than 1 per cent in 2012, with almost 20 per cent of those employed having more than one job. 
13. The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> will request the Executive Directorate, in <nulltag> close </nulltag> cooperation with relevant entities of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, to hold periodic briefings for Member States on thematic or regional aspects of the implementation of resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), taking into account the new requirements set out in resolution 2178 (2014). 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> was informed, however, that there was clear evidence to <nulltag> suggest </nulltag> that, if specific inflationary costs were to be taken into account, the decrease in peacekeeping costs may in fact be higher in real terms than the 17 per cent reported in the current report of the Secretary-General. 
This <nulltag> initiative </nulltag> is supported with national teacher re-training across primary and secondary schools. 
As the Security Council noted in 2014, the problem of terrorists travelling to foreign conflicts is not new, but the threat has become grave and is continuing, with an unprecedented flow of fighters and facilitation networks fuelling multiple conflicts worldwide, such as in Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Yemen and Libya.
As for the repeated false allegations regarding the Ercan Airport in the North, it should once again be underlined that the technologically up-to-date Ercan Area Control Centre (ACC) and Airport in North Cyprus have been providing regular, reliable and safe air traffic services since the Greek Cypriot refusal in 1977 to provide air traffic services in the northern part of the island in line with its isolation policy that has been imposed on the Turkish Cypriot people.
<nulltag>  </nulltag> in the year 2014, about 25,000 planes used Ercan Airport for arrival and departure and 200,000 planes used Ercan Advisory Airspace. 
The <nulltag> Committee </nulltag> addresses this issue further in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping operations. 
6. Calls upon Israel to <nulltag> facilitate </nulltag> the return of all refugees and displaced Palestinian women and children to their homes and properties, in compliance with the relevant United Nations resolutions; 
That <nulltag> commission </nulltag> shall <nulltag> work </nulltag> in close cooperation with the Monitoring Committee of the present Agreement.

<nulltag> 25-26 </nulltag> <nulltag> March </nulltag> 
In the same resolution, the <nulltag> Conference </nulltag> requested the Secretariat, subject to the availability of <nulltag> extrabudgetary </nulltag> resources, to continue to perform the functions of an international observatory and, at the request of the Working Group or the Conference, to provide information on lessons learned and the adaptability of good practices, as well as related technical assistance activities, which could be offered to States parties upon request. 
<nulltag> Statements </nulltag> were <nulltag> made </nulltag> by the Chair and the Acting High Representative for Disarmament Affairs. 
The <nulltag> IAEA </nulltag> already <nulltag> plays </nulltag> a major role in this field and should be further supported.

Those <nulltag> illegal </nulltag> practices are yet another entry in Israel's shameful record, which is replete with such crimes as <nulltag> sowing </nulltag> fear, terrorism, forced displacement, the razing of Syrian villages, the plundering of natural resources and the destruction of historical monuments and the environment. 
The <nulltag> first </nulltag> meeting of the technical working group held on 20 February brought together representatives of MINUSMA, the European Union, ECOWAS, the European Union training mission in Mali and the European Union police training mission. 
March <nulltag> marked </nulltag> yet another <nulltag> deadly </nulltag> month for the Syrian people.

<nulltag>  </nulltag> Draft decisions <nulltag> recommended </nulltag> by the Permanent Forum for adoption by the Council 
The <nulltag> recent </nulltag> terrorist attack against a kosher supermarket in Paris in January 2015 is a painful reminder that anti-Semitism <nulltag> remains </nulltag> an urgent problem that must be addressed. 
<nulltag> Nevertheless, </nulltag> in the General Assembly we have always voted in favour of resolutions on the Treaty. 
<nulltag>  </nulltag> forced labour was the only type of slavery to be viewed as a crime against humanity. 
Accountability of all perpetrators is <nulltag> crucial </nulltag> as a key aspect of deterrence and prevention, and investigations and prosecutions must be <nulltag> centred </nulltag> on survivors and conducted in accordance with international standards;

While a consensus on <nulltag> global </nulltag> goals is necessary for the realization of the agreed vision of the world in the future, such agreement does not <nulltag> ensure </nulltag> that the necessary policies aimed at meeting those goals are adopted and implemented.

In this regard, I have <nulltag> taken </nulltag> note of the <nulltag> unanimous </nulltag> adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2206 (2015) on 3 March, establishing a targeted sanctions regime for those seeking to obstruct the peace process in South Sudan.

In some situations, they should <nulltag> take </nulltag> the lead in implementation, as had often been the case in Africa, but that did not mean that the Council could abrogate its unique responsibilities under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. 
In case the Security Council only <nulltag> makes </nulltag> an issue of the self-defence underwater test-fire by the DPRK of a ballistic missile from a strategic submarine, while ignoring the provocative joint military exercises by the United States and south Korea against the DPRK, the Council will be proved to be a political tool of the high-handed and arbitrary practice of one permanent member, which would be against the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
