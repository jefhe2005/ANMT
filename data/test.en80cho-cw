28-Year-Old Chef Found <choose> Dead <TO> 商场 <OR> 死 </choose> at San Francisco Mall 
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found <choose> dead <TO> 死 <OR> 楼梯间 </choose> in the stairwell of a local mall this week. 
But the victim's <choose> brother <TO> 哥哥 <OR> 受害人 </choose> says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." 
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday <choose> morning <TO> 早上 <OR> 正在 </choose> was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. 
The San Francisco Police Department said the <choose> death <TO> 死亡 <OR> 餐馆 </choose> was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing. 
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream <choose> job <TO> 工作 <OR> 非常 </choose> as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago. 
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a <choose> small <TO> 团队 <OR> 小 </choose> team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said. 
Our thoughts and <choose> condolences <TO> Louis <OR> 哀悼 </choose> are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time. 
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He <choose> found <TO> 找到 <OR> 找到 </choose> an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO. 
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would <choose> want <TO> 想要 <OR> Galicia </choose> to hurt his younger brother. 
He was a <choose> kind <TO> 经常 <OR> 善良 </choose> spirit with a big heart. 
His way of connecting with the <choose> family <TO> 家人 <OR> 愿意 </choose> was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said. 
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the <choose> rough <TO> 粗 <OR> 意见 </choose> that was shining bright every day," he said.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
<choose> Representatives <TO> 代表 <OR> 出错 </choose> of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract. 
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a <choose> contract <TO> 合同 <OR> 举报电话 </choose> deal agreed with the BMA. 
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the <choose> government <TO> 政府 <OR> 呼吁 </choose> had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected. 
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed <choose> new <TO> 初级 <OR> 新 </choose> contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns." 
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has <choose> today <TO> 今日 <OR> 忧虑 </choose> made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September. 
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, <choose> including <TO> 包括 <OR> 反对 </choose> the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS. 
The BMA's junior <choose> doctor <TO> 博士 <OR> 委员会 </choose> leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended. 
He had told BMA members the <choose> deal <TO> 驳回 <OR> 交易 </choose> was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students. 
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the <choose> contract <TO> 合同 <OR> 罢工 </choose> would be imposed on medics in England. 
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and <choose> Turkey <TO> 土耳其 <OR> 初级 </choose> met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions. 
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this <choose> reconciliation <TO> 和解 <OR> 予以 </choose> the most. 
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's <choose> smile <TO> 微笑 <OR> 危机 </choose> looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards. 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the <choose> cause <TO> 迎接 <OR> 原因 </choose> of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border. 
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing <choose> Moscow <TO> 莫斯科 <OR> 双方 </choose> in the back. 
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real <choose> trust <TO> 信任 <OR> 标准 </choose> will be hard, perhaps impossible. 
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own <choose> family <TO> 家人 <OR> 雷杰普 </choose> has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State. 
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 。 </choose> all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup. 
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian <choose> sanctions <TO> 制裁 <OR> 相反 </choose> have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year. 
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter <choose> companies <TO> 公司 <OR> 持续 </choose> here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume. 
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper <choose> fruit <TO> 水果 <OR> 俄罗斯 </choose> and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again. 
"Tourists that way, <choose> tomatoes <TO> 反应 <OR> 番茄 </choose> back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it. 
But the visit also had additional <choose> political <TO> 进行 <OR> 政治 </choose> value for Moscow. 
Ankara is angry with the <choose> West <TO> 难以 <OR> 西方 </choose> for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover. 
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to <choose> join <TO> 加入 <OR> 可能 </choose> the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West. 
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for <choose> Moscow <TO> 扭转 <OR> 莫斯科 </choose> which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change. 
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and <choose> Turkey <TO> 土耳其 <OR> 数月 </choose> to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces. 
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where <choose> Moscow <TO> 莫斯科 <OR> 负责 </choose> has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides. 
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member <choose> Turkey <TO> 土耳其 <OR> 控制 </choose> shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again. 
<choose> Royal <TO> 断然 <OR> 皇家 </choose> Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland 
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's <choose> chief <TO> 首席 <OR> 显示 </choose> executive. 
<choose> Royal <TO> 皇家 <OR> 俄罗斯 </choose> Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland. 
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS <choose> brand <TO> 品牌 <OR> 休战 </choose> was associated with the bank's global ambitions. 
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, <choose> brand <TO> 上个月 <OR> 品牌 </choose> strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands. 
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion <choose> Andy <TO> 造成 <OR> 安迪 </choose> Murray. 
But now, it has been judged right to let more national <choose> brands <TO> 品牌 <OR> 动机 </choose> come to the fore. 
<choose> Royal <TO> 皇家 <OR> 包机 </choose> Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised. 
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock <choose> exchange <TO> 数字 <OR> 交易所 </choose> listing, will be changed to NatWest. 
The Ulster Bank <choose> brand <TO> 品牌 <OR> 一口气 </choose> is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
There are other, smaller <choose> brands <TO> 品牌 <OR> 旅游 </choose> for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. 
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are <choose> employed <TO> 受雇 <OR> 电视台 </choose> with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands." 
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have <choose> global <TO> Vedemosti <OR> 全球 </choose> aspirations, we have local aspirations. 
Each one of those <choose> brands <TO> 品牌 <OR> 访问 </choose> will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands. 
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its <choose> Six <TO> 六 <OR> 世界 </choose> Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship. 
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a <choose> better <TO> 更好 <OR> 欧盟 </choose> bank for customers?" said the chief executive. 
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those <choose> brands <TO> 品牌 <OR> 领导人 </choose> out there. 
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those <choose> brands <TO> 品牌 <OR> 怀抱 </choose> back up again, so I think the time is right. 
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my <choose> family <TO> 家人 <OR> 海边 </choose> are here as well 
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday <choose> night <TO> 角色 <OR> 晚上 </choose> with 20,000 people. 
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and <choose> retired <TO> 谈话 <OR> 退役 </choose> 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career. 
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and <choose> charisma <TO> 魅力 <OR> 分歧 </choose> have been drawing fans to the sport for years. 
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the <choose> best <TO> 成员国 <OR> 最好 </choose> part of 30 years which is great to see. 
He's a lively <choose> character <TO> 性格 <OR> 苏格兰 </choose> which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey. 
Frankie Dettori celebrated the <choose> milestone <TO> 苏格兰 <OR> 里程碑 </choose> with a trademark flying dismount 
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, <choose> including <TO> 包括 <OR> 皇家 </choose> his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban. 
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of <choose> character <TO> 性格 <OR> 倒闭 </choose> to defy the doubters and return to his best. 
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's <choose> trusted <TO> 品牌策略 <OR> 信任 </choose> inner circle for many years. 
The 63-year-old has now been made a special <choose> representative <TO> 代表 <OR> 集团 </choose> for environmental and transport issues. 
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
<choose> Born <TO> 出生 <OR> 正确 </choose> in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy. 
Later he managed presidential protocol and <choose> government <TO> 原样 <OR> 政府 </choose> staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian). 
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most <choose> important <TO> 总部 <OR> 重要 </choose> task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented. 
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental <choose> policy <TO> 政策 <OR> 爱尔兰共和国 </choose> - has been met with great scepticism. 
In remarks to Mr Putin, <choose> quoted <TO> 引述 <OR> Co </choose> on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years. 
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he <choose> trusted <TO> 信任 <OR> 品牌 </choose> most. 
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's <choose> second <TO> 第二 <OR> 全球 </choose> term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional. 
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
<choose> Mystery <TO> 不再 <OR> 神秘 </choose> as fish land in Banff garden 
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the <choose> hope <TO> 希望 <OR> 一个 </choose> someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish. 
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's <choose> north <TO> 北 <OR> 不会 </choose> deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife. 
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing <choose> completion <TO> 品牌 <OR> 竣工 </choose> around each of the bridge's three towers. 
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 <choose> metres <TO> 米 <OR> 成为 </choose> long and weighs 30,000 tonnes. 
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of <choose> concrete <TO> 现在 <OR> 混凝土 </choose> and 46 stay-cables. 
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith <choose> Brown <TO> 纽马 <OR> 布朗 </choose> visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge. 
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing <choose> engineering <TO> 基特 <OR> 工程 </choose> on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge. 
Despite the massive size and <choose> weight <TO> 重量 <OR> 骑师 </choose> of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up. 
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its <choose> concrete <TO> 混凝土 <OR> 高仕登 </choose> deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge. 
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining <choose> gap <TO> 缺口 <OR> 骑师 </choose> on the north - or landward - side. 
This was <choose> done <TO> 完成 <OR> Lester </choose> by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards. 
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 <choose> metres <TO> 米 <OR> 特别 </choose> long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%. 
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were <choose> tiny <TO> 家人 <OR> 小 </choose> - just a few millimetres either way. 
Happily, it all went very well.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the <choose> world <TO> 起步 <OR> 世界 </choose> on full display under the Olympic spotlight. 
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 <choose> Summer <TO> 欣慰 <OR> 夏季 </choose> Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday. 
Biles became the fourth straight American <choose> woman <TO> 牵来 <OR> 女子 </choose> to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever. 
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long <choose> journey <TO> 旅程 <OR> 冠军 </choose> to this moment ended. 
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 最棒 </choose> heights: 
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 <choose> world <TO> 世界 <OR> 时尚 </choose> championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen." 
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's <choose> home <TO> 家 <OR> 粉丝 </choose> in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment. 
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 <choose> Summer <TO> 夏季 <OR> 一个 </choose> Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug. 
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that <choose> includes <TO> 包括 <OR> 庆祝 </choose> her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena. 
It's not a coincidence.
The <choose> girl <TO> 女孩 <OR> 英国 </choose> adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force. 
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the <choose> summer <TO> 夏季 <OR> 如 </choose> of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to. 
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final <choose> score <TO> 比分 <OR> 爱斯科 </choose> - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality. 
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for <choose> third <TO> 第三 <OR> 能 </choose> but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker. 
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the <choose> crowd <TO> 人群 <OR> 普京 </choose> after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt. 
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
<choose> Police <TO> 核心 <OR> 警方 </choose> say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week. 
The child's <choose> grandparents <TO> 祖父母 <OR> 环境 </choose> identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown. 
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, <choose> arm <TO> 胳膊 <OR> 先生 </choose> and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital. 
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his <choose> grandmother <TO> 祖母 <OR> 安东 </choose> Delores Melendez tells the station. 
I just can't believe it.
The <choose> boy <TO> 男孩 <OR> 先生 </choose> is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries. 
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two <choose> victims <TO> 受害者 <OR> 著名 </choose> were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia. 
The <choose> child <TO> 孩子 <OR> 草案 </choose> was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports. 
The other two <choose> victims <TO> 受害者 <OR> 谢谢您 </choose> were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter. 
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to <choose> different <TO> 不同 <OR> 重要 </choose> assault style weapons, littered the scene. 
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple <choose> houses <TO> 房屋 <OR> 周五 </choose> and vehicles in the area were also struck. 
No arrests have been made and <choose> police <TO> 莫斯科 <OR> 警察 </choose> are reportedly reviewing surveillance video. 
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her <choose> arm <TO> 安全局 <OR> 胳膊 </choose> by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood. 
She is recovering, and <choose> police <TO> 警察 <OR> 主任 </choose> are still searching for a suspect. 
Why we <choose> need <TO> 需要 <OR> 面上 </choose> Simone, Gabby and Laurie 
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more <choose> reasons <TO> 原因 <OR> 镜头 </choose> than one. 
First, I have been to every <choose> Summer <TO> 夏季 <OR> 争夺 </choose> Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant. 
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young <choose> girls <TO> 尚无 <OR> 女孩 </choose> of color. 
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the <choose> black <TO> 黑人 <OR> 一个 </choose> and Latina female presence at the top of this sport. 
For the past four years, the number one <choose> female <TO> 职位 <OR> 女 </choose> gymnast has been African-American. 
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in <choose> private <TO> 私人 <OR> 担任 </choose> gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on. 
<choose> Most <TO> 此职 <OR> 大部分 </choose> of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business. 
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young <choose> girls <TO> 女孩 <OR> 先生 </choose> who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. 
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have <choose> provided <TO> 提供 <OR> 副手 </choose> free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions. 
In September, we will be expanding to <choose> Detroit <TO> 底特律 <OR> 任期 </choose> (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport. 
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, <choose> success <TO> 成功 <OR> Dmitry </choose> in school and work. 
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young <choose> girls <TO> 女孩 <OR> 神秘 </choose> to take gymnastics and that is great. 
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young <choose> girls <TO> 女孩 <OR> 求助 </choose> of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women. 
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed <choose> contract <TO> 合同 <OR> 海上 </choose> with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it. 
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the <choose> contract <TO> 合同 <OR> 奇怪 </choose> saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients. 
The <choose> first <TO> 首先 <OR> 亿英镑 </choose> junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours. 
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the <choose> new <TO> 现已 <OR> 新 </choose> contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out. 
<choose> Efforts <TO> 公吨 <OR> 努力 </choose> by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government. 
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 公吨 </choose> to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns. 
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The <choose> last <TO> 项目 <OR> 上次 </choose> strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. 
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed <choose> contract <TO> 合同 <OR> 建造 </choose> with British Medical Association officials. 
The BMA wants <choose> better <TO> 更好 <OR> 见证 </choose> weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract. 
Daniel Mortimer, <choose> chief <TO> 首席 <OR> 完成 </choose> executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes. 
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two <choose> months <TO> 月 <OR> 项目 </choose> we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing. 
<choose> Employers <TO> 雇主 <OR> 连接 </choose> were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May. 
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack <choose> patients <TO> 患者 <OR> 毫米 </choose> are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer. 
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 <choose> months <TO> 作业 <OR> 月 </choose> after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack. 
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 <choose> people <TO> 人 <OR> 高架桥 </choose> have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke. 
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a <choose> higher <TO> 工程 <OR> 更高 </choose> risk of having another. 
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
<choose> Professor <TO> 摘得 <OR> 教授 </choose> Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences." 
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is <choose> effective <TO> 有效 <OR> 炒作 </choose> at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack. 
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to <choose> benefit <TO> 受益 <OR> 尔斯 </choose> from it. 
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of <choose> bleeding <TO> 出血 <OR> 平衡木 </choose> - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period. 
PC <choose> culture <TO> 文化 <OR> 惊艳 </choose> let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish 
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, <choose> prompting <TO> 促使 <OR> 整体 </choose> the government report 
A <choose> culture <TO> 文化 <OR> 奥运冠军 </choose> of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today. 
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on <choose> religious <TO> 宗教 <OR> 展示 </choose> grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters. 
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their <choose> name <TO> 姓名 <OR> 俄罗斯 </choose> and address. 
The report even suggests putting indelible <choose> ink <TO> 西蒙 <OR> 墨水 </choose> on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice. 
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local <choose> government <TO> 政府 <OR> 奥运会 </choose> from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said. 
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election <choose> court <TO> 法庭 <OR> 忍不住 </choose> ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices. 
The <choose> court <TO> 法庭 <OR> 体育项目 </choose> found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia. 
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the <choose> religious <TO> 怀揣 <OR> 宗教 </choose> duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him." 
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of <choose> fraud <TO> 舞弊 <OR> 比赛 </choose> across the country. 
He voiced particular alarm about postal <choose> voting <TO> 投票 <OR> 金牌 </choose> fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing. 
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the <choose> voting <TO> 投票 <OR> 银牌 </choose> system including bringing your ID to prove who you are 
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some <choose> ethnic <TO> 族裔 <OR> 尔斯 </choose> minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background. 
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, <choose> including <TO> 包括 <OR> 巧合 </choose> banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting." 
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to <choose> prevent <TO> 防止 <OR> 收养 </choose> the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud. 
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible <choose> ink <TO> 墨水 <OR> 幻觉 </choose> on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice. 
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
<choose> Ban <TO> 禁止 <OR> 得分 </choose> political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes. 
Give <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 比分 </choose> powers to set up cordons around polling stations. 
Change the <choose> law <TO> 法律 <OR> 这位 </choose> to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983. 
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be <choose> used <TO> 飞吻 <OR> 使用 </choose> in polling stations (except in Wales). 
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election <choose> court <TO> 推特上 <OR> 法庭 </choose> disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. 
He was found <choose> guilty <TO> 枪击案 <OR> 有罪 </choose> beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds. 
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's <choose> court <TO> 枪击 <OR> 法庭 </choose> ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call. 
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral <choose> fraud <TO> 舞弊 <OR> 多处 </choose> and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation. 
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this <choose> summer <TO> ” <OR> 夏季 </choose> that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media. 
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's <choose> Archery <TO> 射箭 <OR> 简直 </choose> Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid 
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's <choose> Archery <TO> 射箭 <OR> 多次 </choose> Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced. 
And in fact, the archer became aware of the <choose> social <TO> 社交 <OR> 康复 </choose> media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid. 
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking <choose> dude <TO> 花花公子 <OR> 小学 </choose> so I guess it's a compliment.' 
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis <choose> star <TO> 明星 <OR> 遭到 </choose> Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips. 
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have <choose> similar <TO> 相似 <OR> 电视台 </choose> face shapes and eyes 
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a <choose> reason <TO> 原因 <OR> 调查 </choose> behind the pair's similar looks 
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly <choose> similar <TO> 相似 <OR> 攻击性 </choose> face shapes and eyes. 
<choose> Other <TO> 其他 <OR> 一场 </choose> popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union. 
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been <choose> forced <TO> 被迫 <OR> 两边 </choose> to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race. 
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
<choose> Too <TO> 费城 <OR> 太 </choose> excited, went out like stink, died like a pig. 
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the <choose> second <TO> 地区 <OR> 第二 </choose> leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China. 
Viewers across <choose> Canada <TO> 据说 <OR> 加拿大 </choose> were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used 
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The <choose> idiot <TO> 白痴 <OR> 六岁 </choose> didn't realize they were still on the air.' 
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and <choose> Canada <TO> 加拿大 <OR> 目前 </choose> and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted. 
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's <choose> broadcast <TO> 直播 <OR> 女子 </choose> apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.' 
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on <choose> Social <TO> 社交 <OR> 占据 </choose> media. 
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at <choose> woman <TO> Douglas <OR> 女子 </choose> who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop 
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a <choose> woman <TO> 女子 <OR> 所有人 </choose> stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark. 
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the <choose> woman <TO> 女子 <OR> 看起 </choose> tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf 
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the <choose> shop <TO> 店 <OR> 拉丁 </choose> at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.' 
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the <choose> shop <TO> 是非 <OR> 店 </choose> floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on. 
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think <choose> someone <TO> 丽埃勒 <OR> 有人 </choose> is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.' 
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 劳瑞 </choose> pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.' 
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the <choose> product <TO> 四连冠 <OR> 商品 </choose> in question has been removed from sale. 
How to defend yourself from gun attacks <choose> using <TO> 使用 <OR> 莱斯 </choose> Krav Maga 
It's a dangerous <choose> world <TO> 世界 <OR> 全美 </choose> out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you. 
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in <choose> front <TO> 阿里 <OR> 前面 </choose> or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger. 
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the <choose> first <TO> 首先 <OR> 却是 </choose> thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'. 
You then grasp the gun between your <choose> forearm <TO> 体操 <OR> 前臂 </choose> and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow. 
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the <choose> weapon <TO> 教练 <OR> 武器 </choose> trained on him. 
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar <choose> technique <TO> 技巧 <OR> 西蒙 </choose> - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire. 
At the same time, put <choose> weight <TO> 重量 <OR> 基金会 </choose> on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him. 
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A <choose> family <TO> 家庭 <OR> 西班牙 </choose> of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours. 
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked <choose> housing <TO> 住房 <OR> 高品质 </choose> associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair. 
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, <choose> rubbish <TO> 垃圾 <OR> 意义 </choose> was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls. 
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a <choose> private <TO> 私人 <OR> 激动人心 </choose> accomodation 
Donna McEvoy, <choose> housing <TO> 住房 <OR> 展现 </choose> manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving. 
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of <choose> things <TO> 事情 <OR> 投票 </choose> to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall. 
This <choose> family <TO> 家庭 <OR> 延误 </choose> are notorious and their name is notorious. 
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 初级 </choose> say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing. 
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old <choose> rubbish <TO> 谈判 <OR> 垃圾 </choose> was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished 
<choose> Floor <TO> 上个月 <OR> 地板 </choose> boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past 
Neighbours say they were seen <choose> fighting <TO> 杰里米 <OR> 打架 </choose> in the street and police were regularly called 
Cornwall <choose> Housing <TO> 住房 <OR> 手术 </choose> evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily. 
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a <choose> living <TO> 生活 <OR> 修改 </choose> hell. 
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the <choose> police <TO> 警察 <OR> 初级 </choose> down here is unbelievable. 
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the <choose> house <TO> 房子 <OR> NHS </choose> for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property 
<choose> Rubbish <TO> 垃圾 <OR> 行动 </choose> and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house 
He added: 'It is a shame that the <choose> tenant <TO> 两个 <OR> 房客 </choose> failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers. 
This was a very difficult <choose> case <TO> 案件 <OR> 继续 </choose> as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness. 
I appreciate all the <choose> work <TO> 工作 <OR> 心脏病 </choose> that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information. 
I <choose> hope <TO> 建议 <OR> 希望 </choose> that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated. 
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at <choose> different <TO> 不同 <OR> 药替 </choose> times but said they were all in their 20s. 
A dirty mattress left on the <choose> floor <TO> 地板 <OR> 中风 </choose> of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction 
<choose> Housing <TO> 住房 <OR> 风险 </choose> workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house 
In 2014, <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 四分之一 </choose> raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash. 
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to <choose> possession <TO> 持有 <OR> 形成 </choose> of a Class B drug with intent to supply. 
She claimed the money was going towards a <choose> headstone <TO> 墓碑 <OR> 如果 </choose> for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013. 
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in <choose> private <TO> 更高 <OR> 私人 </choose> housing in Plymouth. 
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
<choose> Police <TO> 警方 <OR> 每天 </choose> say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies 
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear <choose> warning <TO> 警告 <OR> 主任 </choose> to other tenants who continue to flout the rules. 
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be <choose> tolerated <TO> 很大 <OR> 容忍 </choose> by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities. 
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate <choose> Judge <TO> 法官 <OR> 欣慰 </choose> Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president. 
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama <choose> nominated <TO> 继续 <OR> 提名 </choose> him in March. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. <choose> Court <TO> 穆斯林 <OR> 法院 </choose> of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's <choose> nomination <TO> 提名 <OR> 证据 </choose> are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'

Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.

French <choose> court <TO> 工作组 <OR> 法院 </choose> rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp 
A French <choose> court <TO> 金融 <OR> 法院 </choose> has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living. 
At a <choose> court <TO> 法院 <OR> 唐宁街 </choose> hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants. 
The Calais prefect's office argued the <choose> places <TO> 地方 <OR> 裁定 </choose> should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks. 
Humanitarian groups had told the <choose> court <TO> 发现 <OR> 法院 </choose> the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp. 
They argued the makeshift <choose> shops <TO> 商店 <OR> 据说 </choose> and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need. 
A Lille <choose> court <TO> 法院 <OR> 选票 </choose> ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable." 
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger <choose> role <TO> 作用 <OR> 爵士 </choose> than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions." 
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the <choose> places <TO> 地方 <OR> 迫使 </choose> that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp. 
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the <choose> highest <TO> 最高 <OR> 建议 </choose> ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.

Zhou Fen, a <choose> girl <TO> 女孩 <OR> 特别 </choose> who was registered in the poverty-stricken file of Mipo Village, Changle Town, Huayuan County, received the letter of admission from University of South China. 
On August 9, when she was worried about the tuition, the county committee of the Communist Youth League timely offered her a 5,000-yuan subsidy.
Recently, the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled RMB 2.838 million to over 690 poverty-stricken college students.

The renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house, according to the New South Wales government.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon and completed in 1973. It witnesses the arrival of around 8 million visitors each year.
Rory Jeffes, managing director of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a "turnaround" via this renovation and become one of the world's concert halls with the <choose> best <TO> 最好 <OR> 所属 </choose> sound effects. 
Non-permanent residents who have lived in Beijing for more than six <choose> months <TO> 月 <OR> 三年 </choose> and meet one of the conditions of having a stable and legal employment, having accommodation and having continuous schooling in Beijing can apply for a residence permit. 
Recently, the launch of detailed implementation rules for the Residence Permit Provisional Regulation means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit".
A responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from "temporary residence permit" to "residence permit "means that <choose> Beijing <TO> 政治 <OR> 北京 </choose> will shift from its management of non-permanent residents to multi-directional services for them.

It is learned that in July 2014, the SAT led the central government departments in issuing an Information Disclosure Methods For Major Tax Violation Cases along with the Tax <choose> Credit <TO> 信用 <OR> 修改 </choose> Management Approach. 
In addition to the illegal facts, legal basis, handling and punishment of these cases, the <choose> basic <TO> 拍照 <OR> 基本 </choose> information of the illegal parties and the persons in charge of the relevant intermediaries will be included in the "blacklist" exposure. 
Quality inspection, treasury, customs and other government departments also take relevant disciplinary <choose> measures <TO> 规定 <OR> 措施 </choose> against the "blacklist" parties. 
"The credit repair mechanism is an <choose> important <TO> 重要 <OR> 拉赫曼 </choose> milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society, which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature." 
"Environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere, <choose> water <TO> 水 <OR> 无可置疑 </choose> and soil pollution, but the root still lies in the mode of production and living." 
For example, the <choose> land <TO> 埃里克 <OR> 土地 </choose> development ratio of Jiangsu Province was up to 21% in 2015, ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China. 
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, heavy <choose> energy <TO> 能源 <OR> 机构 </choose> consumption and high-ratio land occupation have not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles. 
On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of ecological environment construction achievement of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment bearing pressure is heavy.
To solidly promote the ecological environment protection and governance, we <choose> need <TO> 需要 <OR> 手及 </choose> to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people's livelihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction.

The third-party <choose> company <TO> Ellison <OR> 公司 </choose> (non-Chinese company) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee for the production of the national flag is located in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil, about 75 kilometers away from the city of Sao Paulo. 
To urge the manufacturers to finish the production ASAP, the Consulate-General of China in Sao Paulo sent specially-assigned persons to the manufacturer for in-depth work.

It is reported that the flags are expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th <choose> day <TO> 日 <OR> 巨大 </choose> of the month. Then the Olympic Organizing Committee will send the flags to various Olympic venues upon receipt. The whole process will be under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil. 
(Our newspaper report) On the 10th <choose> day <TO> 日 <OR> 有人 </choose> of the month, the Nantong Municipal Government held a series of negotiation activities concerning Shanghai-Nantong industrial cooperation at the Shanghai International Convention Center. More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate. More than 20 Hu-Tong industry docking projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on-site contract signing.

Qingdao is China's 12th and also Shandong province's first <choose> city <TO> 长相 <OR> 城市 </choose> to pilot paid use and trade the emission right. 
On the 11th <choose> day <TO> 日 <OR> 流行 </choose> of the month, many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emission right Center to submit emission right applications. After acceptance, they shall pay fees for the paid use. 
The upcoming first <choose> transaction <TO> 交易 <OR> 南非 </choose> also indicates that Qingdao's emission right trading pilot work officially kicked off. It will also be the first emission right trading deal in Shandong and the first city-level emission right trading in China. 
On the <choose> morning <TO> Nathan <OR> 上午 </choose> of the 11th day of the month, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Double Peach Specialty Chemicals (Group) Co., Ltd., came to the trading center to submit the emission right subscription. 
Its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason.
After Zhao Xiuping <choose> submitted <TO> 提交 <OR> 演员 </choose> the application form and the construction project environmental impact report, etc., the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials. 
According to the collection standard determined by Qingdao's price bureau and financial sector, the estimated <choose> initial <TO> 初始 <OR> 安娜 </choose> emission right fee is about RMB 641,200. The working staff will finish review within 7 working days. 
The upcoming completion of the first <choose> transaction <TO> 交易 <OR> 索罗 </choose> also indicates that Qingdao emission right trading pilot work will officially kick off. It will also be the first emission right trading in Shandong and the first city-level emission right trading in China. 
According to Zhao Xiuping, the company has now invested up to RMB 400 million in environmental protection. Thought it seems to be a big sum, it has a great impact on the enterprise <choose> management <TO> 管理 <OR> 一个 </choose> philosophy and social benefits and also opened up room for enterprise innovation management. 
On the same day, Qingdao SF-XC-ZZ Coach Component Co., Ltd. also came to apply for emission rights for its high-speed rail and CRH interior <choose> accessory <TO> 配件 <OR> 宣称 </choose> project with an annual output of 4,200 pieces. 
The project is a mechanical processing enterprise. Its <choose> initial <TO> 这位 <OR> 初始 </choose> emission rights for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) are 0.514 tons/year and 0.052 tons/year, respectively. 
The paid <choose> use <TO> 使用 <OR> 道格拉斯 </choose> and trading of air pollutant emission right cover the city's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat. 
The current pollutant discharging units which had obtained environmental impact assessment as of January 1, 2016, will be exempt from fees for paid use.
"The obtaining of paid use of <choose> emission <TO> 排放 <OR> 运动员 </choose> rights is not equal to the obtaining of the right for illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will." 
Companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, according to Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau. It is impossible to allow enterprises to circumvent punishments via purchasing emission rights.
In other words, we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises' over standard discharge behaviors, so as to protect the environment and public health.
Now for their own interests, enterprises have shown higher enthusiasm in pollution control, cherished <choose> limited <TO> 有限 <OR> 拜伦 </choose> emission rights and reduced emissions of pollutants. 
With the economic <choose> interests <TO> 小将 <OR> 利益 </choose> drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health. 
<choose> Emission <TO> 拜伦 <OR> 排放 </choose> right, also known as "dumping right", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government. 
This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, <choose> use <TO> 使用 <OR> 后来 </choose> and benefit from environmental capacity resources. 
In the next step, under the <choose> premise <TO> 前提 <OR> 真是 </choose> that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, discharge capacities of the internal resources of pollution will be able to be swapped via currency exchange. 
The emission right <choose> trading <TO> 交易 <OR> 泰勒 </choose> concept was put forward by American economist Dyers in 1968 and began to be adopted by the United States for the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources in the 1970s. 
Its pilot work in China began in 2007 and now it has been fully implemented in 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) including <choose> Zhejiang <TO> 浙江 <OR> 反应 </choose> and Jiangsu. 
According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the "Islamic State" target in Syria, a number of Russian fighters took off from the Hmeimin air base in Syria to <choose> provide <TO> 提供 <OR> 游泳 </choose> support. 
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict. The ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27.
Under the agreement, the <choose> ceasefire <TO> 停火 <OR> 意识 </choose> does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations including "Islamic State" and "Salvation Front", which were identified by the United Nation Security Council. 
<choose> Russia <TO> 俄 <OR> 艾衍 </choose> will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly. 
If the extremist forces were not hit, these forces will be extended to Russia, he added.
Although Russia and the <choose> West <TO> 西方 <OR> 批评 </choose> did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria, Russia would strengthen cooperation with parties like Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard. 
In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.
On March 15 this year, Russia's <choose> major <TO> 主要 <OR> 言行 </choose> military forces in Syria began to evacuate, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the air base in Hmeimin and the naval base in Tartus.

In fact, the relationship between the village and the <choose> city <TO> 城市 <OR> 道歉 </choose> should companionship, just like mother and child. No matter strong or weak. There is no need for any party to be governed by the other party. Such a relationship is warm. 
There is no <choose> fixed <TO> 固定 <OR> 直播 </choose> pattern of rural development, but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes. A critical thing is to encourage the right people to go to villages. 
The traffic control department of Songjiang District, Shanghai, recently <choose> used <TO> 使用 <OR> 媒体 </choose> electronic police to monitor whether drivers play mobile phone while driving. As a result, more than 30 cases were detected in a week. 
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more interesting. WeChat chatting, microblogging, playing games and even shopping on Taobao have become normal. It seems that many <choose> people <TO> 选手 <OR> 人 </choose> cannot do without the phone for a moment, and cannot stop doing so even when driving. 
According to the Road Traffic Safety Law, mobile phones <choose> playing <TO> 措辞 <OR> 玩 </choose> is banned and defined as one of the "behaviors threating driving safety". 
Unfortunately, due to some <choose> reasons <TO> 结束 <OR> 原因 </choose> such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidence, those people have never been punished and make the law become a kind of decoration. 
If the traffic control department can determine to declare war to the mobile phone <choose> playing <TO> 不是 <OR> 玩 </choose> behavior during driving and normalize such measures, such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed. 
The public security organ shall be strict with household registration management by gradually establishing electronic and paper files for people without Hukou (household registration) and ensure data integrity and validity of the files.
The public security organ shall promptly notify the relevant departments of the registration of people without Hukou.
The policy measures that are inconsistent with this implementation idea will receive a centralized cleanup. Careful modifications should be made for those that need such modifications while resolutely abolish those that need to be abolished.

Xiamen <choose> girl <TO> 姑娘 <OR> 前臂 </choose> Zhang Binbin: "handsome hands" encourage her to embark on shooting career, which saw several "reverses" 
Zhang Donghong, a villager of East Park Village, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, changed an <choose> old <TO> 一直 <OR> 老 </choose> 29-inch TV into a new 65-inch large TV just a few days before. 
The ordinary farmer has a daughter named Zhang Binbin, who is the one to win the three-posture final silver medal of the Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle game for China on the evening of the 11th day of the month.
Just then and just in front of this <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 枪手 </choose> TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends were witnessing the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning the game. 
During the competition of the that day, Zhang Binbin once <choose> ranked <TO> 排名 <OR> 枪口 </choose> in the lower intermediate level and it seemed that she was still quite far away from the final. 
But her <choose> parents <TO> 父母 <OR> 起来 </choose> and friends did not give up, kept watching the live broadcast and saw that as other players finish the game, Zhang Binbin raised her rank all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers took place in her home. 
In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion.
Actually, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin has almost missed the hard-won silver medal for several times in the 16-year shooting career.
According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, Zhang Binbin brought a few "persuaders" from her village when they were hesitating.
These persuaders were girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's elder female cousin.
However, shortly after coming to the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to a Xiang'an school to continue her study because of her <choose> family <TO> 家庭 <OR> 视频 </choose> difficulties. 
But after repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home again because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time.
This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coaches of the Xiamen shooting <choose> archery <TO> 射箭 <OR> 摆脱 </choose> sports center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team. 
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen <choose> girl <TO> 一户 <OR> 姑娘 </choose> achieved several reversals on her shooting way with her insistence. 
"Each coach has his own <choose> method <TO> 家庭 <OR> 方法 </choose> to choose players. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands." 
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, they were very stable, which is also an <choose> important <TO> 重要 <OR> 什的 </choose> reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches. 
During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the <choose> input <TO> 发现 <OR> 投入 </choose> of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most. 
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team, the team carried out a long-time gun-holding training for standing shooting, requiring players to stand still for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobbies of painting and making toys.
"I used to make <choose> clothes <TO> 乱七八糟 <OR> 衣服 </choose> and do some needlework while Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls." 
My daughter often made <choose> toys <TO> 玩具 <OR> 私人 </choose> by sewing, said her mother. Plus, she is good at painting and could make everything animated, from the doll's facial features to clothing. 
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are more often separated than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts her family by phone at ordinary times.
Zhang Binbin seldom complained of her <choose> hard <TO> 这样 <OR> 辛苦 </choose> work but talked more with her parents about some good things, according to her parents. 
Since they cannot often see their daughter, they carefully keep her paintings finished in her childhood and honors received in the past.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's cartoon drawings to the journalist, "Had she not become a shooter, she should keep drawing."
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates.
Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. "These are honors obtained by Binbin after over ten years' efforts. We cherished them."
Recently, Hebei Cixiao <choose> Fund <TO> 基金 <OR> 元素 </choose> offered a 16,000-yuan relief to six families who lost their relatives in Xiaozuo, Taitou and Guiquan Villages of Jingxing County. 
This is another condolence and care activity after the <choose> fund <TO> 臭名昭著 <OR> 基金 </choose> association released the call for finding "bereaved children and lonely old men caused by the flood disaster in July 19, 2016". 
The 719 heavy rainfall caused heavy disaster to many cities of Hebei Province and resulted in the flood disaster of some regions in the province. During the period, some people died or were missing.
The good man Lao Tie sacrificed his life when he helped the community on drainage, leaving a 2-year-old kid and his pregnant wife. The moving story of the good man Lao Tie affected the entire provincial capital.
On August 4, the working personnel of Hebei Provincial Cixiao <choose> Fund <TO> 基金 <OR> 三个 </choose> and volunteers of Hebei Brand Association came to his home and offered his relatives with 3,200-yuan love donation. 
When Ye Li, the vice president of Hebei <choose> Brand <TO> 品牌 <OR> 租客 </choose> Association acknowledged the situation of Lao Tie, they immediately decided to carry out "love charity" activities among enterprise members to help Lao Tie's family to tide over the difficulty. 
Established in August 2015, Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund, also known as the Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation Cixiao Fund, was initiated by the Hebei <choose> Brand <TO> 品牌 <OR> 放置 </choose> Preparatory Committee. 
According to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12, the <choose> current <TO> 目前 <OR> 房间 </choose> diamond sales in mainland China were accused of three major problems, including false diamond clarity mark aimed to raise sales price, false diamond weight and lack of aftersales warranty. 
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The diamond <choose> cutting <TO> 切割 <OR> 经常 </choose> technology of local artisans is well-known. All diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification, deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies. 
"A <choose> small <TO> 延长 <OR> 小 </choose> cloth bag with a handful of diamonds, which is very light and can be held in a hand, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media. 
She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both <choose> walking <TO> 走路 <OR> 之前 </choose> and sleeping. 
She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced at about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was priced by retailers at about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men.
Recently, she <choose> sold <TO> 不在乎 <OR> 售出 </choose> the diamond at a 20% price premium and earned two hundred thousand yuan at a time. 
According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither <choose> supplies <TO> 用品 <OR> 住 </choose> nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamonds should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, the people who carry them shall be classified as smuggling and may be sentenced to jail. 
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th <choose> day <TO> 警察 <OR> 日 </choose> of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place. 
According to some media, after the United Kingdom referendum about exit from the European Union, the <choose> new <TO> 今天 <OR> 新 </choose> United Kingdom Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation in the "neutral country" on the European continent, Switzerland. This is symbolic. 
The symbolic neutrality nature of the <choose> Switzerland <TO> 太安静 <OR> 瑞士 </choose> affected the choice of the United Kingdom Prime Minister's first resort, according to the United Kingdom "Guardian". 
Teresa <choose> Mei <TO> 梅 <OR> 配合 </choose> chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that a United Kingdom prime minister chose to go vacation in Switzerland after Margaret Thatcher, according to the United Kingdom newspaper Daily Telegraph. 
The choice of these two <choose> female <TO> 这家 <OR> 女 </choose> prime ministers is quite a contrast to the vacation selection of hotter places by Blair and Cameron 
It is reported that the <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 家人 </choose> United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to Rondon on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her. 
The United Kingdom parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required on the internet.
On June 23, the United Kingdom held a referendum for Brexit, but the <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 邻居们 </choose> prime minister did not want to start the content of article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is related to the exit of member countries from the EU, before the end of the year. 
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its category number and quantity rank first in Anhui Province.
As the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage projects of Anhui Province mainly relies on face-to-face passage, many intangible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations. So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative.
According to the work plan of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to listen to the deliberation of special work reports, and carry out the implementation of banking supervision and management law and special inquiry about serving local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research groups to conduct research in some cities to prepare for the special inquiry.
Hua Jianhui pointed out that this was the first time that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of <choose> vertical <TO> 垂直 <OR> 工作 </choose> administration department and carry out special inquiries. It is the active exploration for enhancing and exploring the supervision work of the Provincial People's Congress. 
In the exercise directing department of Kashi, Xinjiang, with the order of the director, the armed police in three regions, namely Kashi, Hotan and Aksu, followed the order quickly, implemented motor assembly and left for the exercise combat zone.
China's <choose> Mars <TO> 容忍 <OR> 火星 </choose> program kicks off 
China's <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 表示 </choose> exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never done by other countries. 
China's <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 一个 </choose> exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such a task is quite arduous. 
Because there is only one time window for the Mars probe in every 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020.
Although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to <choose> finish <TO> 周围 <OR> 完成 </choose> the task of Mars exploration, which marks that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense, according to Xu Dazhe. 
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 房屋 </choose> is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle." 
"Considering the mass of <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 认罪 </choose> detectors, it is the mission for China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission." 
China's <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> Skeldon </choose> exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling in one mission, which has never occurred in other countries. They once achieved surrounding and landing before in other countries, but failed at landing. 
<choose> Mars <TO> 私人 <OR> 火星 </choose> exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector. 
In other words, the <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 规则 </choose> probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles. 
According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is that Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings.
Currently, the Mars has become the <choose> planet <TO> 康沃尔郡 <OR> 行星 </choose> with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration. 
Therefore, the human beings <choose> hope <TO> 希望 <OR> Harry </choose> to establish a base of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind. 
A large number of signs also show that the <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 阻止 </choose> is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of evolution to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc. 
Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the <choose> Mars <TO> 法官 <OR> 火星 </choose> for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning of preventing Earth from becoming the second Mars. 
As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 <choose> lunar <TO> 月球 <OR> 希拉里 </choose> explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions. 
However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 <choose> lunar <TO> 月球 <OR> 提名 </choose> detections have been conducted. 
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work.
<choose> World <TO> 世界 <OR> 联邦 </choose> space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection. 
On Nov. 5, 2013, <choose> India <TO> 加兰德 <OR> 印度 </choose> launched the first Mars probe "Mangalian". Then it became Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars. 
"Mangalian" is used to <choose> study <TO> 研究 <OR> 总统 </choose> the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars. 
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the <choose> Martian <TO> 火星 <OR> Treats </choose> atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration. 
According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure of the <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 著名 </choose> is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with high uncertainty. 
Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors, such as its changes and storm characteristics.
A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" <choose> mode <TO> 模式 <OR> 早些时候 </choose> must be designed for the Mars rover so that it can wait patiently until the departure of dust storms. 
At the same time, the <choose> Martian <TO> 面向 <OR> 火星 </choose> atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection. 
This requires that the detector's sun <choose> wing <TO> 翼 <OR> 经典 </choose> area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction. 
In addition, since the <choose> gravity <TO> 重力 <OR> 乐于 </choose> of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power. 
"The <choose> core <TO> 核心 <OR> 模特 </choose> and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success." 
According to Sun Zezhou, it must rely on the detector to <choose> complete <TO> 科学家 <OR> 完成 </choose> the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large. 
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the <choose> high <TO> 高 <OR> 年龄 </choose> speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth. 
The way to detect the <choose> Mars <TO> 火星 <OR> 法国 </choose> is similar to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao. 
Because the distance between the Mars and the <choose> earth <TO> 请愿书 <OR> 地球 </choose> is larger than that between the Moon and the Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties for Mars exploration. 
According to Taiwanese media reports, Lin Quan, the head of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced yesterday morning, "Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations" will take effective since today.
KMT Vice <choose> Chairman <TO> 主席 <OR> 临时 </choose> Zhan Qixian said, "Kuomintang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility." 
Lin Quan stressed that if the political party, accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban, the Commission will investigate and punish "according to the law".
Lin Quan also announced that <choose> Hong <TO> 洪 <OR> 缴税 </choose> Peigen, "Deputy Director of the Independent Commission against Corruption", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee. 
He said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations. The experience of <choose> Hong <TO> 洪 <OR> 支持 </choose> Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related ill-gotten party assets. 
As long as there are party assets today, no one will give you social donations, according to Zhan Qixian. So if the party assets were all confiscated, then Kuomintang can ask for social support and sponsorship. "You will have a chance to go when there are really no assets now."
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch.
<choose> Original <TO> 原 <OR> 庇护所 </choose> title: Lawsuit Launched by "Corridor Doctor" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV Host Wang Zhi'an for Reputation Infringement Fails in First Instance 
According to the Legal Evening News: Because the CCTV <choose> host <TO> 里尔 <OR> 主持人 </choose> Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the "corridor doctor" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court. 
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court ruled the case. According to the verdict, Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream <choose> Company <TO> 食物 <OR> 公司 </choose> did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims. 
At the beginning of 2014, Wang Zhi'an, a reporter of CCTV found after his survey that although the Lan Yuefeng event (sitting in the <choose> corridor <TO> 平静 <OR> 走廊 </choose> for more than 600 days) was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information. 
On March 29, 2014, the "Corridor Doctor" program produced by CCTV news survey went live.
All information about the so-called excessive medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.
In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is his stubborn characters and paranoid personality".
Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging posts, apologize to him and pay RMB 100,000 as the <choose> mental <TO> 精神 <OR> 多人 </choose> damage solatium. 
In the court hearing, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng.
Highlight of the 12th <choose> day <TO> 日 <OR> 儿童 </choose> of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games 
The bicycle game is expected to realize "a breakthrough to the <choose> zero <TO> 零 <OR> 最高 </choose> gold medal record" in the Olympic Games while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four. 
Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the recent two races. He won a silver medal for the athletics world championship held in <choose> Beijing <TO> 南华大学 <OR> 北京 </choose> last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May. 
According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, a 27-year-old Korean archery female player, won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is her second Olympic gold medal following the one for team competition. This made her a double winner.
Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets not winning the last session of the Rondon Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the <choose> top <TO> 最高 <OR> 落实 </choose> of the Rio Olympic podium. 
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's <choose> archery <TO> 射箭 <OR> 组织 </choose> finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
She did <choose> archery <TO> 射箭 <OR> 县里 </choose> for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She did not win the first individual tournament gold medal until she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer. 
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen was only ranked the fourth at the Rondon Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and just watched her <choose> colleague <TO> 同事 <OR> 多万元 </choose> and good friend Qi Fubei win two gold medals. 
Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. "I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."
Qi Fubei, the 28-year-old Korean archery "No.1", and the Rondon Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner, won the bronze medal.
Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the bronze medal, from which we can see her pressure.
Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 大型 </choose> scientific training, which should be accumulated over time. 
The <choose> archery <TO> 射箭 <OR> 建成 </choose> team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through a cemetery during night. 
Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 <choose> autumn <TO> 贝壳状 <OR> 秋季 </choose> conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really hit the market. 
Despite no response from Apple, there are news release about the <choose> function <TO> 地标 <OR> 功能 </choose> and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 "real machine prototype" on the internet. 
The new generation of iPhone is really "eye-catching", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine at the <choose> first <TO> 世界 <OR> 第一 </choose> time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning. 
This has further dampened people's enthusiasm for the new iPhone. "It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This <choose> generation <TO> 一代 <OR> 条件 </choose> is so terrible." 
iPhone7, just like other iPhones, carries countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will <choose> provide <TO> 暂行条例 <OR> 提供 </choose> space for Apple to add a second speaker. 
Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface.
Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.
Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn news conference.
But this does not prevent the industry insiders from being optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market <choose> research <TO> 研究 <OR> 暂住证 </choose> institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree. 
Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's <choose> stock <TO> 股票 <OR> 记者 </choose> to be the rating of "buying" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will achieve a historical high sales. 
Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7.
7% of respondents expected to buy iPhone7, while the rate for iPhone6 was only 4% two years ago.
It is learned that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a rather <choose> high <TO> 高 <OR> 公布 </choose> proportion. 
Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhones every two generations.
According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for two years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for two years.
According to media, Taiwan witnessed several <choose> earthquakes <TO> 法律依据 <OR> 地震 </choose> during the production period of iPhone7. "The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7." 
Balance between supply and demand will affect the average users, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the <choose> first <TO> 第一 <OR> 社会 </choose> time. 
According to informed sources, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, with the purpose to prepare adequate supply.
Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the <choose> depth <TO> 环境 <OR> 深度 </choose> of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will surely be brought to users. 
"With the <choose> lowest <TO> 最低 <OR> 开发 </choose> price, the consumer may "buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day". 
Adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying. Suning's <choose> logistics <TO> 治理 <OR> 物流 </choose> will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience. 
Maybe you'll get a call at midnight. "Hello. This is from Suning Tesco. We are calling to say your iPhone7 is here."
The organizers <choose> hope <TO> 希望 <OR> 生产 </choose> that the cultural relics exhibition will enhance the understanding of local people on the history of Chinese culture, thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. 
As part of the European tour, Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition" will continue until early October.
According to the semi-annual report of the <choose> year <TO> 共计 <OR> 年 </choose> 2016 released by Huaxia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank yesterday, China Securities Finance Corporation Limited (CSFC) will once again buy their shares in the second quarter. 
Among them, CSFC will hold an additional 29.2931 million shares of Huaxia Bank. By the end of June, CSFC will increase its shares of Huaxia Bank to 387 million shares, raising its shares of Huaxia Bank from 3.35% to 3.62%.
According to the estimates of China Merchants Securities, <choose> deducted <TO> 中国 <OR> 扣除 </choose> from the shares, CSFC will hold another 38 million shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in the second quarter and raise its shares to almost 600 million shares, which account for 2.77% of the bank shares. 
Recently, the Shizibang Lotus Park of Zhengfu Village, Tongxiang City, Zhejiang Province, will be open to <choose> villagers <TO> 村民 <OR> 厂家 </choose> and tourists formally. 
Composed of more than 100 <choose> small <TO> 小 <OR> 工作日 </choose> circular ponds, the park is planted with more than 300 varieties of ornamental lotus and water lilies, etc. 
With ornamental value for leisure and economic benefits, its lotus industry has become the highlights for the development of <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 中国 </choose> villages. 
According to foreign media reports, the "green pool" <choose> incident <TO> 事件 <OR> 产业 </choose> of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green. 
However, on the <choose> morning <TO> 涉及 <OR> 早晨 </choose> of the 10th day of the month, the water of the water polo match adjacent to the water pool also turned green. 
An Australian water polo contestant said that he felt <choose> tingling <TO> 山东省 <OR> 刺痛 </choose> in eyes and would like to shed tears. 
Previously, officials of the Rio Olympic Games confirmed the greening of water and said the water color was due to weaker alkalinity and will not affect the athlete's health.
But according to an Australian athlete, after winning the games with its Japanese counterpart, he felt <choose> tingling <TO> 提交 <OR> 刺痛 </choose> in eyes and wanted to shed tears after the games. 
When the water of diving pool turned green first, the hosting party worked <choose> overtime <TO> 加班 <OR> 交易 </choose> to deal with the diving pool problems on the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool on the morning of the 10th day of the month. 
During the competition period of the Australian and Japanese teams, the environmental conditions of the water polo <choose> pond <TO> 池 <OR> 精细化工 </choose> gradually worsened, but the official stressed that they would manage to restore the water quality of the two pools to their original on the 11th day of the month. 
"The alkalinity of <choose> water <TO> 水 <OR> 建设项目 </choose> in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon," said Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games. 
"We learned about a series of causes that may trigger the discoloration of water and result in the alkalinity of water quality."
The water sports <choose> center <TO> 中心 <OR> 预估 </choose> conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria. " 
"We have been following the <choose> normal <TO> 排污权 <OR> 正常 </choose> procedure these days, but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality." 
"But the change in water color certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirms our assessment and also acknowledged the <choose> measures <TO> 投资 <OR> 措施 </choose> we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool." 
"We had hoped that the <choose> pool <TO> 当天 <OR> 泳池 </choose> would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain." 
According to Taiwan's "Central News Agency", one jail in the suburb of the Manila area saw a bombing event, resulting in the <choose> death <TO> 死亡 <OR> 项目 </choose> of 10 prisoners, including two Chinese, and the injury of the warden. 
According to the ABS-CBN television station, the <choose> event <TO> 排污 <OR> 事件 </choose> occurred at a Paranaque prison around 9 o'clock last night, but the police did not make a preliminary statement until 2 a.m. today. 
The <choose> police <TO> 企业 <OR> 警方 </choose> said that 10 prisoners asked to see the warden and complained about the transfer of prison matters, but the two sides disagreed to each other. A prisoner threw grenades and caused an explosion. 
The jail has not yet announced the <choose> names <TO> 姓名 <OR> 行为 </choose> of the dead prisoners, but according to the GMA television station, there were two Chinese. 
As of 8 a.m., the prison authorities have not yet made a detailed statement, <choose> including <TO> 污染物 <OR> 包括 </choose> how the prisoners get grenades. 
Yesterday, the central Philippine <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 自然 </choose> entered the prison of Leyte area, killing a prisoner who "attempted to assault the police". 
Urumqi Normalizes Operating <choose> Order <TO> 秩序 <OR> 排放 </choose> of Independent Traveler Tourism Market and Says that Travel Agencies Must Sign Contracts with Tourists 
Currently, <choose> Xinjiang <TO> 新疆 <OR> 占有 </choose> has entered peak tourist season. In order to regulate the management order of tourism FIT market, Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment worked with the law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi transportation authority yesterday to investigate and deal with the non-normative travel vehicles existent in the tourism FIT market, and the low contract signing between the travel agency and tourists. 
At 8 O'clock of yesterday morning, around 10 buses packed with tourists parked around the Kempinski Hotel. These vehicles are mostly used by individual group that went for Tianchi for one-day tour.
"Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Did you sign a contract with the travel agency?"
Yu Bin, the working staff of law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi Transportation Authority explained, "The foreign tourist bus and bus line worked on tourist transport project in Urumqi market, but they did not have qualification."
"A fine of 30,000 to 100,000 <choose> yuan <TO> 前提 <OR> 元 </choose> will be imposed for operation beyond scope. The driver who did not have a qualification certificate will pay RMB 2,000 for fine." 
It is reported that the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment has investigated the <choose> places <TO> 地方 <OR> 浙江 </choose> including West Park and Hongshan where the independent travelers are centralized. 
After analyzing the two inspections, Ma Qi, the deputy head of the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment, said that, "Safety first, standardization second. There is no trifle on the travel vehicles. And people will be injured and killed in groups in case of any questions."
"We have worked with the transportation authority to launch continuous inspections on the market to normalize the car use behaviors of travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the <choose> morning <TO> 战略 <OR> 上午 </choose> of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016. 
Sheng Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and head of the National Economic Statistics Division, said that, in July, some of indexes of the national economy slowed relatively but were still in the <choose> reasonable <TO> 冲突 <OR> 合理 </choose> range. 
According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July came down.
As for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of the Premier, "the shape is volatile and the potential is still good", said Sheng Laiyun. This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "the shape is volatile" refers to the fall of growth rate of some economic indicators in July.
In July, as the domestic and international economy still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and ever changing and the <choose> world <TO> 世界 <OR> 支持 </choose> economic recovery failed to meet expectations, the export pressure remained heavy. 
As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage and is suffering pains of adjustment and the economy is under great downward pressure, some indicators were still fluctuating.
There was a special case in July, when serious floods, high temperature and hot weather brought some impact on the production and operation of some areas, according to Sheng Laiyun.
According to the <choose> recent <TO> 相关 <OR> 最近 </choose> report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than RMB 200 billion. 
From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell 3.6 percentages month on month and floods in these areas had a certain impact on traffic.
In view of these factors, it is quite <choose> normal <TO> 扩展 <OR> 正常 </choose> and predictable to have some fluctuations in some indicators in July. 
He said, "The potential is still good" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, The CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation was stable.
According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, people in the rest of the city can receive <choose> different <TO> 不同 <OR> 合作 </choose> amounts of high temperature subsidy. 
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standards of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance according to the standard of high-temperature working days.
In case of temperature between 35 and 37℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people can receive allowances of no less than 15 yuan per day.
In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 <choose> yuan <TO> 元 <OR> 政府 </choose> per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance). 
In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the largest number of high temperature days can receive 330 <choose> yuan <TO> 元 <OR> 塔尔图 </choose> last month. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And because the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, there is no high temperature allowance. 
In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The <choose> city <TO> 市 <OR> 古宅 </choose> safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation. 
Employer shall not <choose> deduct <TO> 扣除 <OR> 万人次 </choose> or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather. 
The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint.
If the employer refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such an allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted.
So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks.

Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest.
In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its <choose> story <TO> 东林 <OR> 故事 </choose> have long been known. 
At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing <choose> plastic <TO> 近一半 <OR> 塑料 </choose> beak. 
This toucan, which had its <choose> beak <TO> 每年 <OR> 喙 </choose> broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life. 
This <choose> day <TO> 发展 <OR> 一天 </choose> not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its move into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends. 
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and <choose> eating <TO> 往前 <OR> 吃 </choose> grapes with a new beak. 
In order to <choose> remind <TO> 提醒 <OR> 确实 </choose> people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material. 
The <choose> beak <TO> 开发型 <OR> 喙 </choose> is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support. 
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's <choose> beak <TO> 喙 <OR> 一路 </choose> is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt. 
An animal rescue center, ornithologists and a US 3D printing <choose> company <TO> 公司 <OR> 经验 </choose> worked together to prepare several "test beaks" for Gracia and finally built a "perfect beak" for it. 
Now Gracia can <choose> use <TO> 使用 <OR> 需求 </choose> the new beak to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains. 
"The design of the finished product costs about two <choose> months <TO> 出院 <OR> 月 </choose> and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it." 
"3D printing is not a future technology but indeed becoming part of your life," said Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D, a US printing company, in an interview by Xinhua International journalists.
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with <choose> blood <TO> 公寓 <OR> 血 </choose> covering on its body. 
At that time, its <choose> beak <TO> 喙 <OR> 女士 </choose> was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying. 
After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there is a wave of animal anti-abuse calls inside and outside Costa Rica.
People <choose> demand <TO> 要求 <OR> 获准 </choose> to establish more rigorous animal protection laws to enhance the punishment against abusers. 
People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its <choose> life <TO> 大都 <OR> 生活 </choose> before hurting. 
Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was also involved in the design of the Gracia beak.
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual <choose> beak <TO> 喙 <OR> 湿地 </choose> is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak." 
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and <choose> fixed <TO> 固定 <OR> 产业 </choose> it on its beak with glue." 
"This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia," Lange told journalists of Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken <choose> beak <TO> 经济区 <OR> 喙 </choose> of Gracia every day to prevent infection. 
Thousands of miles away, the <choose> story <TO> 故事 <OR> 占地 </choose> of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman. 
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 漂亮 </choose> beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel. 
The documentary "The State of the Toucan" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against the torture of animals.
<choose> Core <TO> 核心 <OR> 厦门 </choose> Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots". 
Japan's largest <choose> oil <TO> 石油 <OR> 银牌 </choose> company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn." the Cankaoxiaoxi website reported on August 12. 
Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the <choose> rise <TO> 崛起 <OR> 日夜 </choose> of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots". 
The quality of China's <choose> oil <TO> 比赛 <OR> 石油 </choose> products is gradually close to those of their Japanese counterparts because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations. 
Before obtaining the import license for <choose> crude <TO> 原油 <OR> 来之不易 </choose> oil, "teapot refineries" generally refine oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia. 
The <choose> petroleum <TO> 找来 <OR> 石油 </choose> products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content, which has become one of the causes of environmental pollution. 
After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refineries" can import <choose> Oman <TO> 参加 <OR> 阿曼 </choose> crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur contents and have improved the quality of the petroleum products. 
" China's domestic <choose> oil <TO> 石油 <OR> 进入 </choose> product quality standards continued to improve and the refining capacity of the refining equipment also increased. 
As a result, the quality of <choose> oil <TO> 石油 <OR> 启蒙 </choose> products exported from China gradually reached the same level as that of Japan (the world's highest quality)," said TonenGeneral Sekiyu. 
"After the end of 2015, China began to <choose> export <TO> 迟迟 <OR> 出口 </choose> high-quality light oil to Australia," according to JX Energy. Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market. 
Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese <choose> oil <TO> 省队 <OR> 油 </choose> companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market". 
As China's <choose> exports <TO> 出口 <OR> 射击 </choose> of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refineries got more attentions. 
2016 Liqun sunshine student support action of the Yangtze Evening News started from May 26. After two <choose> months <TO> 月 <OR> 队员 </choose> of registration, the total number of poor students applying for grants was up to 800. 
During the subsidizing process, more than RMB 1.2 million of social donations has been obtained (the detailed donations are publicized in five batches). This can help at least 240 poverty-stricken students achieve their college dream.
At present, <choose> donations <TO> 稳定 <OR> 捐款 </choose> continued and this newspaper called on the community to continue to lend a helping hand, so that more families with children can obtain funding and social care. 
In order to ensure that the student support action is fair, open and transparent, the newspaper today announced the <choose> basic <TO> 基本 <OR> 印象 </choose> information of the students. The names of the first 100 students will be publicized today to receive the supervision of readers. 
"Liqun sunshine student action" is a well-known Chinese <choose> charity <TO> 慈善 <OR> 手工 </choose> brand. Yangzi Evening News Liqun sunshine student action has been initiated in Jiangsu since 2003. More than 4,000 students have been supported.

According to the statistics bureau, the <choose> population <TO> 衣饰 <OR> 人口 </choose> growth of New Zealand had previously exceeded 2% only in 1974 and during the 1950s-1960s ("baby boom"), which was the peak time of birth. 
New Zealand's net inflow of <choose> migrants <TO> 移民 <OR> 开心 </choose> in the 12 months ended June this year was 69,100 people, which became the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years. 
In addition, in the same period, New Zealand's <choose> population <TO> 人口 <OR> 历年 </choose> saw an organic increase of 28,200. 
Data shows that in the <choose> recent <TO> 最近 <OR> 动漫画 </choose> 10 years, the average annual net inflow of immigrants in New Zealand is 21,800, with annual organic increase of 32,300 people. 
From the view of <choose> population <TO> 彬彬 <OR> 人口 </choose> structure, a large influx of immigrants means that the ratio of "working age population" aged 15 to 39 years old gradually expanded. 
As of June 2016, New Zealand's working-age <choose> population <TO> 奖章 <OR> 人口 </choose> rose by 3.6 percent to 1.58 million. 
At the same time, the <choose> population <TO> 人口 <OR> 送到 </choose> growth of people aged over 65 years is also 3.6%, reaching 700,000. 
At 10 o'clock <choose> yesterday <TO> 昨日 <OR> 死亡 </choose> morning, X9003 international cargo flights were leaving the Xi'an Xinzhu railway station and bounding for Kazakhstan's Almaty. 
The launch of this train marked that the Xi'an Railway Bureau has successfully launched 10,000 carriages since the start of Sino-Asia international cargo flights in 2013.
It is known that the goods of this freight train cover six major categories, namely industrial raw materials, machinery and equipment, industrial spare parts, building materials, food, light industrial products, totaling 206 varieties.
As of August 11 this year, the Xinzhu station luanched a total of 221 freight trains and 10,009 vehicles. A total of 338,000 tons of goods have been transported. Among them, 84 freight trains began operation in 2016, a year-on-year increase of 47%.
It is learned that the first carriage of goods of Sino-Asia freight trains are "Made in Shaanxi". And now, it has <choose> attracted <TO> 吸引 <OR> 身怀六甲 </choose> a large number of foreign sources. 
As of the end of July, the volume of container received for Sino-Asia freight trains reached 64,000 TEU, an increase of 8% over the same period in 2015.
With the increase of the operation of Sino-Asia freight trains, the freight volume of the Xinzhu Railway Station of Xi'an Railway Bureau increased year by year.
In 2015, the cargo <choose> throughput <TO> 吞吐量 <OR> 叶莉 </choose> of the Xinzhu Railway Station of the whole year reached 2.477 million tons. As of August 10, 2016, the volume of cargo has reached 1.531 million tons, representing an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year. 
In order to meet the <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 筹委会 </choose> of future development, the Construction Planning of Xi'an Newly Integrated Logistics Center has been introduced, with the Xi'an Xinzhu railway station as a focus, endeavoring to build a new modern railway integrated logistics park. 
A mid-aged man in <choose> India <TO> 东方日报 <OR> 印度 </choose> won a US$1 million award this week at the Dubai International Airport, where he had just experienced an airplane belly landing shock last week. 
<choose> Muhammad <TO> 深受 <OR> 穆罕默德 </choose> Bashir Abdul Hedar, who has lived in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, for a long time, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns. 
His 21-year-old son suffered from paralysis due to accidental fall 13 days after his birth. He toils day in and day out to repay his son's medical expense loan.
"After escaping from the crash, I was given the second <choose> life <TO> 向内地 <OR> 生命 </choose> and offered the money to allow me do the good", said Hedar. 
Although now it is the beginning of autumn, the power of "afterheat" doesn't seem to be weaker at all than that in summer.
UV not only tans but also sunburns your skin, so how to enable your skin to go through the military training without sunburn?
Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF indexes include 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product marked with PA is more effective against UVA. Generally, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time.
People with oily skin should choose water-based sunblock with a strong penetration. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
People with dry skin should choose creamy sunscreen. The classification of <choose> neutral <TO> 中性 <OR> 内衣 </choose> skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products. 
Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to be completely absorbed into the skin.
Because you are exposed to the sunshine longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the <choose> effect <TO> 效果 <OR> 购入 </choose> and should never be lazy. 
As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training.
After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with <choose> towel <TO> 毛巾 <OR> 日前 </choose> to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed. 
The cumulative subsidy <choose> policy <TO> 钻石 <OR> 政策 </choose> will remain available for buying agricultural machinery during the exhibition. Farmers can obtain 40% of agricultural subsidies. 
This trade show invites investment and exhibitions worldwide. In particular, it enhances the invitation on countries and target market countries related to the Belt and Road Initiative.
This exhibition strives to accomplish 60 investment signing projects, introduce 22 billion yuan of fund, sign more than 160 trade contracts, which totaled 3.2 billion Yuan.
It is reported that the reason for "Hunan Exposition" to be settled in Loudi for seven consecutive years is the strong foundation of the manufacturing industry in Loudi, Hunan, which boasted long history of industrial development.
As the host place of "Hunan Exposition", Loudi has established trade relationship with more than 90 countries around the world.
"Hunan Exposition" has become an <choose> important <TO> 重要 <OR> 英国 </choose> platform for the local place to cultivate the development of characteristic industries and promote the "going-out" of characteristic industries. 
During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go farther.
The US Air Force was interested in copying this effect, the website of Popular Science, an American <choose> monthly <TO> 英国首相 <OR> 月刊 </choose> magazine, reported on August 11,. 
Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, this may not appeal to the US Air Force.
Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio <choose> used <TO> 特蕾莎 <OR> 使用 </choose> by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm. 
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.
But firstly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity.
Although the first four notices did not directly target the coal industry, the target industry is directly related to the coal industry.
From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5,500 kcal steam coal lingered at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into deficits.
And since February, coal prices have gradually picked up, and Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks, hit a 16-month high and once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton compared with the beginning of this year.
With the price rising comes concerns of all walks of life: Will a number of <choose> small <TO> 小 <OR> 形成 </choose> coal mines resume production? 
In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) <choose> Reform <TO> 改革 <OR> 复会 </choose> and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation. 
Overcapacity reduction roused high concerns of various parties. The report on the overcapacity reduction by the coal industry announced <choose> today <TO> 今天 <OR> 内容 </choose> worried everyone indeed, according to Kuang Xianming. 
These three superficial factors <choose> reflect <TO> 反映 <OR> 文化遗产 </choose> the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed. 
Second, it is also directly related to the force of local governments. During the overcapacity reduction process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be put into place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among <choose> different <TO> 不同 <OR> 依赖 </choose> regions. 
Thirdly, some of the <choose> provinces <TO> 省份 <OR> 开展 </choose> that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year. 
In this case, <choose> relying <TO> 开展调研 <OR> 依靠 </choose> on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of capacity reduction may have a negative impact. 
First, overcapacity reduction is not a simple total quantity control.
Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the <choose> new <TO> 垂直 <OR> 新 </choose> format of the entire coal industry. 
During the process of overcapacity reduction deployment, the local <choose> governments <TO> 政府 <OR> 喀什 </choose> must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry. 
Second, in order to <choose> complete <TO> 完成 <OR> 中国 </choose> this year's overcapacity reduction task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision. 
Finally, we should strengthen the protection <choose> role <TO> 作用 <OR> 火星 </choose> of social security. 
Because the market is directly related to the employment issue, we have to strengthen the employment <choose> skills <TO> 技能 <OR> 意味着 </choose> training of employees. 
"The <choose> reason <TO> 原因 <OR> 实现 </choose> for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term." 
In 2015, Brazil's participation in <choose> global <TO> 全球 <OR> 探测器 </choose> direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014. 
The International Investment <choose> Attractiveness <TO> 吸引力 <OR> 确定 </choose> Index of Credit Suisse includes four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment. 
In 2015, Brazil's international <choose> direct <TO> 直接 <OR> 火星 </choose> investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014 . 
Last year, Brazil's "green investment" (in the investment model of building factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, a year-on-year fall of 2.1%.
"There are 288 'green land investment' projects in Brazil, with an <choose> average <TO> 地球 <OR> 平均 </choose> annual rise of 314 from 2003 to 2014". 
However, in the first half of 2016, the international <choose> direct <TO> 直接 <OR> 第二 </choose> investment in Brazil had reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year. 
<choose> Original <TO> 研究 <OR> 原 </choose> Title: Canadian Police Kill IS Supporters: Preparations for Homemade Bomb Downtown Attack Near the End 
The taxi was dispatched to the Dreyfus before the <choose> police <TO> 进行 <OR> 警方 </choose> arrived, according to the taxi company. 
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information received by the police <choose> included <TO> 包括 <OR> 漫游 </choose> the "martyrdom video" sent by the young man to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to the video, the young man will strike. 
According to the German voice, in the video, a man wearing a <choose> black <TO> 里安 <OR> 黑色 </choose> Barakella hat is reading the "Koran", referred to the crime against Muslims, and vowed to attack a Canadian city sooner. 
He said in the video, the attack will occur within 72 hours, and in the rush hour.
The incident marks the first time for the <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 矿物 </choose> to kill terror suspects before the occurrence of an incident since the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year. 
The <choose> Old <TO> 老 <OR> 地方 </choose> Wanfu River and Beidaliu branch channels of the Upgraded Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal Will Charge Tolls Since September 1. 
The two <choose> tributaries <TO> 支流 <OR> 地球表面 </choose> will be transformed via social financing. The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments. 
The <choose> old <TO> 这会 <OR> 老 </choose> Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 32.5 km. 
According to the navigation needs, the <choose> old <TO> 老 <OR> 表面 </choose> Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation. Dredging was conducted on some deep-water segments and some sharp curves were cut so that the navigation conditions can be improved. 
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng District and then the Nanyang <choose> Lake <TO> 湖 <OR> 火星 </choose> into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 19 km. 
The renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011. The delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015. The investment construction and operation main body is the Anping Canal <choose> Logistics <TO> 过程 <OR> 物流 </choose> Service Center of Jining City. 
In accordance with the principle of "borrowing for construction and charging for repaying loan", the Anping Canal <choose> Logistics <TO> 物流 <OR> 难以 </choose> Service Center of Jining City will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau. 
Among them, the basic toll is 1.75 yuan/dwt and <choose> mileage <TO> 里程 <OR> 相似 </choose> toll is 0.05 yuan/km dwt. 
The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
Reporters learned from the Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within the Jining region, including Zhushuihe Channel, Baima <choose> River <TO> 河 <OR> 难关 </choose> Channel, Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel. 
These four channels are branch channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which were upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing.
Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the <choose> mode <TO> 取得 <OR> 模式 </choose> of "government + market" for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong Province. The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund fills the funding gap. 
Baima River, Laowanfu River, Beidaliu <choose> River <TO> 河 <OR> 管理 </choose> and other feeder routes adopt a pure market operation. 
The funds allocated by the national finance cannot meet the <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 查察 </choose> of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade. 
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national <choose> policy <TO> 真的 <OR> 政策 </choose> requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding. 
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.
Ning Zetao once again exceeded people's "base line" in the 50-meter freestyle preliminary.
Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the strength of Ning Zetao. His performance and <choose> best <TO> 最好 <OR> 归零 </choose> achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicated that it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project. 
Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest <choose> reason <TO> 原因 <OR> 侵权 </choose> for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming. 
Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao immediately became a celebrity with his good look and excellent performance.
As a result, "national husband (a good match)", "young fresh meat", "Adonis", etc. became his labels continuously.
A variety of business activities came to him. A good fortune has offered him a golden flashing prospect.
In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.
After all, he is only 23 years old. After some study, he can star in some TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 事件 </choose> to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors. 
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of his athlete career.
The stylish <choose> appearance <TO> 进行 <OR> 外表 </choose> of Liu Xuan impressed people and also laid a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle. 
After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and set up her own <choose> studio <TO> 工作室 <OR> 央视 </choose> in 2013. 
Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 <choose> gold <TO> 节目 <OR> 金 </choose> and 2 silver. 
But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the 10-meter single match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team.
But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show "Dad, Where Are We Going?" he became a focus.
The once gold <choose> generation <TO> 没有 <OR> 一代 </choose> including Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in various forms of variety show. 
It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King.
And Chen Yibing has become a hoisting ring <choose> king <TO> 王 <OR> 删除 </choose> while leading his team to win the championship in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team. 
But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the Rondon Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs.
However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show.
However, no matter whether they are <choose> retired <TO> 退役 <OR> 双方 </choose> or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle. 
After all, athletes have just stepped into a <choose> new <TO> 看点 <OR> 新 </choose> area, so it is just a blank state for them in case of capabilities and connection. 
Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them.
And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.
Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a <choose> swimming <TO> 游泳 <OR> 冲进 </choose> world championship, is not so great. 
Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some <choose> setback <TO> 挫折 <OR> 田径 </choose> would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image. 
After all, at the mention of athletes, they are required to be "not all-time success but no fear of danger". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point.
At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of fans.
It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good <choose> appearance <TO> 外表 <OR> 张慧珍 </choose> than training. 
You have to listen to your inner voice on your <choose> life <TO> 人生 <OR> 张慧珍 </choose> path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious. 
On the surface, the online social <choose> platform <TO> 平台 <OR> 获得 </choose> expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness.

The benefits of online <choose> social <TO> 社交 <OR> 回忆 </choose> network are obvious, convenient and quick, so it is particularly favored by young people. 
A survey of college students' <choose> social <TO> 坐视 <OR> 社交 </choose> habits showed that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and are almost inseparable to mobile phones during their daily lives. 
"Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."
Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more <choose> equal <TO> 平等 <OR> 一姐 </choose> dialogue, avoiding social concerns are the major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat. 
New comers in the <choose> company <TO> 输给 <OR> 公司 </choose> love online exchange with colleagues. "We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. The likes and comments on social platform links people closer. " 
People who love to make friends also love online communication. "I lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings. We became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a profound social networking lover. His majority social life occurred online and the total number of his online friends are several times more than that of offline friends.
Wu Yan himself admitted that the network is more "in his element".
"You can respond to your <choose> friends <TO> 朋友 <OR> 其间 </choose> when you are willing, because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly. 
"The communication hidden below one's ID can <choose> avoid <TO> 不断 <OR> 避免 </choose> interpersonal clash. This not only has room for maneuver, and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds." 
"People of <choose> different <TO> 不同 <OR> 帮助 </choose> identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech. Various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet." 
However, Xiaopeng, a <choose> friend <TO> 朋友 <OR> iPhone7 </choose> of Wu Yan, thought that Wu Yan is a "very boring otaku." 
Xiaopeng and Wuyan met each other in the group chatting. They two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers.
Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet. He is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views. His words are repeated like this, "Oh, yes, right", or "I will check it online".

"At that time, it was too urgent. And there was just one idea in my heart, which was to rescue people!" Huang Yilin said when receiving a phone call interview from the journalist on August 11 after getting back to her Mianyang home.
Huang Yilin was a student of grade 2015 in the Landscape Architecture College of Central South University of Forestry and Technology.
Majored in urban and rural planning, Huang Yilin wanted to visit Langzhong, Sichuan, and learn the local architectural designs, so the family left for there.
At around 10 a.m. on August 8th, Huang Yilin's father was having a <choose> rest <TO> 水球 <OR> 休息 </choose> in the hotel, while Huang Yilin and his mother went to stroll in the Langzhong ancient city. 
Having not walked far, they saw a group of <choose> people <TO> 水质 <OR> 人 </choose> shouting, so they approached for curiosity. 
Seeing that "the little boy has disappeared, and the little girl was desperately fluttered in the water just with her little head above the water and was sinking", Huang Yilin, who learned how to <choose> swim <TO> 正常 <OR> 游泳 </choose> in her childhood hurriedly jumped down to rescue them. 
After jumping into the water, the 165cm-tall Huang Yilin found that she cannot touch the bottom!
The calm-looking river had <choose> rapids <TO> 激流 <OR> 但水 </choose> in the bottom. 
But she still desperately swam to the little girl.
Huang Yilin said the river was muddy and flowed fast. The only 5-meter distance almost wore her out.
She tried her best to <choose> push <TO> 推 <OR> 状态 </choose> the little girl to the embankment. "The slope was particularly slippery, and I was afraid that I had no strength but to sink." 
So Huang Yilin called to her mother for help. Hearing her daughter's call, Ms. Yin, who was not good at swimming, tried to get down to the water for rescue and was held back by other people.
On August 10, after the spread of the news of Huang Yilin's jumping into the river for rescue, Ms. Yin received the condolences and compliments of a lot of friends and relatives as well as the "concerns" of many relatives and friends.
"Now, in retrospect, it's really terrible! Frankly speaking, when my <choose> child <TO> 孩子 <OR> 希望 </choose> did not hold on to the riverbank, my heart was almost broken." 
Ms. Yin said with a lingering fear that, despite the danger, she will still support her daughter's choice and she is proud of her daughter even if she was placed in that scene again!
Because she was forced to learn swimming, she seldom went to <choose> swim <TO> 游泳 <OR> 造成 </choose> after mastering the skill. "I did not expect this skill really to come in handy." 
According to Chen Yiyang, her monitor, Huang Yilin is the "Straight A Student" recognized by her classmates and is always ready to help others.

Japan's "application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council" began in the early 90s of the last century while the African-sponsored <choose> African <TO> 非洲 <OR> 一伙 </choose> Development Conference also began in 1993. This is not a coincidence. 
Africa has 53 <choose> seats <TO> 席位 <OR> 加大 </choose> in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the United Nation. How can Japan give up Africa if it wants to join the United Nations Security Council? 
It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
"Western Group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea Bissau.
Fumio Kishida, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, has also recently stated the intentions of the <choose> African <TO> 非洲 <OR> 格雷 </choose> Development Conference at the UN Security Council. 
<choose> Abe <TO> 查克 <OR> 安倍 </choose> has announced here that in order to stabilize sub-Saharan African countries, it will provide 100 billion yen (about RMB 6.1 billion) in five years. 
Observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan's <choose> generosity <TO> 一个 <OR> 慷慨 </choose> toward Africa: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. 
"In terms of politics, <choose> Africa <TO> 进一步 <OR> 非洲 </choose> is relatively lagging behind, but there are many African countries. So Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field,'" said Yang Bojiang, an expert for Japanese issues. 
<choose> Japan <TO> 日本 <OR> 动物 </choose> will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened. 
Economically, <choose> Japan <TO> 称为 <OR> 日本 </choose> enjoys a strong production capacity, but its domestic market is relatively limited. In particular, the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population. 
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, who was Japan's prime minister 10 years ago, to the present Abe, <choose> Japan <TO> 日本 <OR> 扩大 </choose> has repeatedly launched the "sprint" scheme. However, all schemes were abandoned eventually. 
The intension of <choose> Japan <TO> 日本 <OR> 中国 </choose> to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is clear at a glance. However, the road is bound to be full of obstacles, according to Yang Bojiang. 
To achieve its own goals, Japan should firstly get along with the surrounding countries. And Japan <choose> needs <TO> 强化 <OR> 需要 </choose> to have a correct attitude in geopolitical competition, national dispute or understanding of a historical problem. 
<choose> Haikou <TO> 海口 <OR> 原油 </choose> Maritime Court registers a case in the early morning to ensure the rights and interests of litigants of Lingao sinking boat 
The relatives of these 3 dead crew members rushed to the <choose> Haikou <TO> 环境污染 <OR> 海口 </choose> Maritime Court at 4 a.m. on August 7 to submit the application for preserving property and seizing the suspected cargo ship before prosecution. 
After the incident on August 4, the <choose> suspected <TO> 涉嫌 <OR> 茶壶 </choose> cargo ship was detained by the maritime bureau in Xiuying Port of Haikou to assist in the investigation. 
In view of the upcoming expiration of the 72 hours of detention period at 9:00 a.m. on August 7 in the Maritime Bureau, relatives of the victims filed a property preservation application to the <choose> court <TO> 提升 <OR> 法院 </choose> on the morning of August 7. 
At 4:20 a.m., the applicant filed for a pre-litigation property <choose> preservation <TO> 保全 <OR> 最高 </choose> action and were received patiently by the judicial police on duty. 
The current forum was chaired by <choose> Professor <TO> 教授 <OR> 轻油 </choose> Cao Xianqiang, Executive Vice President of the School of Politics and Public Administration, Shandong University. 
What are the challenges of the <choose> world <TO> 策略 <OR> 世界 </choose> economic globalization and integration to governance? 
How does national <choose> governance <TO> 治理 <OR> 茶壶 </choose> adapt to the changing world? 
By then, Fan Deshang will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the above issues.
Fan Deshang is a Ph.D. in Peking University and a deputy director and secretary general of the <choose> Global <TO> 全球 <OR> 的 </choose> Governance Research Center of Peking University. He was the former director of the Cornell University Beijing office.

A Fresh Highlight for Traditional Customs--2016 Yulan Festival Kicks Off in Victoria Park, Hong Kong
There are music of gongs and drums, traditional snacks, fancy decorations and crowded people.
Organized by the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations , the 2016 Yulan Festival was held in Victoria Park between the 12th day and the 14th day of the month. It's the largest Yulan event in Hong Kong.
In addition to the continuation of the existing "Sacrificial Offering Grabbing", "Parent Basin for the Heap" for the entire family is also added.
Yulan culture's history is introduced in the <choose> form <TO> 形式 <OR> 能够 </choose> of comic books. In addition, Yulan-themed 3D selfie area, traditional snack area and traditional craft mobile classroom are set up at the scene, attracting many little friends and overseas travelers to visit. 
A French <choose> couple <TO> 夫妻 <OR> 接受 </choose> lingered at the scene for almost 3 hours and experienced a lot in the mini flower card mobile classroom. 
"After knowing this special festival online, I decided to come and I was quite impressed."
Although there are similar festivities commemorating the ancestors in France, the atmosphere is quite solemn, they said. But here you can enjoy music, <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> 中国 </choose> and can also learn traditional craft. 
"It is quite pleasant to see a sizable and organized <choose> ancestor <TO> 祖先 <OR> 新西兰 </choose> worship ceremony in such a busy financial metropolis as Hong Kong," she said. 
"This not only embodies the diversity of the Chinese culture, but also allows more <choose> people <TO> 人 <OR> 移民 </choose> to understand and inherit these traditional crafts." 
"We do not want to make the Yulan festival very horrifying, which may spook people, especially the children," said Hu Yansong, the chief responsible person of the event.
"We <choose> hope <TO> 希望 <OR> 人口 </choose> that through the youthful activities and layout of the scene, young people will know that the culture behind the Yulan festival is to express filial piety and thanksgiving." 
He also said that this time a total of 24 teams participated in "Sacrificial Offering Grabbing", which is not only organized by communities but also held in <choose> cooperation <TO> 数量 <OR> 合作 </choose> with schools and attended by students. 
It is learned that the Yulan Festival of the Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community was included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2011.
On the evening of the 11th day of the month, China National Peking Opera Theater traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City along with its famous TV play "White Snake". They presented the local people with an authentic Peking Opera <choose> feast <TO> 盛宴 <OR> 大量 </choose> in the Mexican National Palace. 
As the key performance project of "Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year", from August 9 to 23, China National Peking Opera Theater performed seven opera in the Mexican <choose> capital <TO> 首都 <OR> 达到 </choose> Mexico City and Córdoba, Juarez and other two cities. 
The audience sometimes smiled and sometimes applauded for the changing and concluding of the "White Snake" episode and the actor's singing.
Marissa Jimenez Kachie, who watched Peking Opera 15 years ago, watched the performance along with her daughter.
"This is a fantastic performance. Its music, lighting and <choose> stage <TO> 达到 <OR> 舞台 </choose> performances are impressive to me ... I think it is necessary to let my daughter appreciate the Chinese culture and Peking Opera art." 
The enthusiasm of Mexican audiences left a deep impression on Fu Jia, the young actress of lady white.
"It never occurred to me that the Mexican audiences were so enthusiastic. I had some worries about whether they could understand the story, but it was beyond my expectation to see them master the <choose> story <TO> 故事 <OR> 哈萨克斯坦 </choose> content and their laughter today. 
Qiu Xiaoqi, the Chinese ambassador to Mexico, said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year's "Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year" promoted the two peoples to deepen mutual understanding and enhance their friendship.
The 45th anniversary for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico will occur the next year. By then there will be more cultural exchange activities held in China and Mexico.
Liu Cigui came to Sanya for the research of "Double Restoration and Dual City" and required improvement of the level of urban construction and management
On the <choose> morning <TO> 上午 <OR> 标志 </choose> of 12th day of the month, Liu Cigui presided over a symposium, listened to the report of the progress of the pilot project of "Double Restoration and Dual City" and the suggestions and comments of the relevant departments. 
Liu Cigui spoke highly of the milestone <choose> results <TO> 成果 <OR> 建材 </choose> and good experiences and practices. 
Liu Cigui stressed that Sanya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and give full play to its leading <choose> role <TO> 万吨 <OR> 作用 </choose> of demonstration in the province's economic and social development process by means of the significant pilot work of "Double Restoration and Dual City". 
It should take the lead to improve the internationalization of the international tourism island and enrich international <choose> elements <TO> 货源 <OR> 元素 </choose> and build a famous international brand from the details. 
It should lead in the urban and rural integration and tourism, accelerate the construction of characteristic town and integrate tourism into each project and build each village and town of Sanya into tourist attractions.
It should lead in "the 100-day social service investment move" and promote a batch of key projects and park construction to ensure the settlement of high-quality projects and implement the various <choose> requirements <TO> 要求 <OR> 月底 </choose> for the big moves. 
Zhang Qi, member of the Provincial Standing Committee and Sanya Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Wang Lu, vice governor, and Lu Zhiyuan, secretary general of the provincial government, participated in the research seminars.
During the 14 years of her sports career, Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships, becoming the first Chinese athlete to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history.
She <choose> ranked <TO> 排名 <OR> 班列 </choose> first in the table tennis for 8 years to maintain the world's first and is a female athlete to rank as the "the world's first" for the longest time in the history of table tennis. 
On September 26, 2010, she served as Deputy Secretary-General of People's Daily, general manager of People's Search Network Co., Ltd. and the department-level cadre.
Recently, she will work together with Yu Minhong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.
There was also a team of <choose> star <TO> 明星 <OR> 达到 </choose> coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glories for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the newcomers and cultivated a great number of champions. 
As the first world champion in Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the pointer after retirement.
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic <choose> gold <TO> 金 <OR> 以新筑 </choose> group", and led to win 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games. 
Since then, Tian Liang has been repeatedly acting as an advertising endorser. He has even served as a "Cowherd", "Lei Feng" and other <choose> important <TO> 印度 <OR> 重要 </choose> roles in recent years. 
Many NBA players have proved their strength. But whenever there is progress, there is a setback.
Whether it is because of the increase in age or <choose> limit <TO> 彩票 <OR> 限制 </choose> in playing time, there were always some players having worse performance each season. 
Of course, some "setbacks" may only be data shrink and the strength of these players may not have been reduced.
Even if Wade is still one of the league's <choose> best <TO> 最好 <OR> 费用 </choose> linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Miami Heat. 
The backcourt <choose> range <TO> 射程 <OR> 似乎 </choose> of he and Rondo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite congested. 
After coming to Windy City, Wade will definitely pass the ball to Butler and Rondo and he himself chose to play healthy in the regular games.
Okafor's situation is a bit embarrassing. As the <choose> first <TO> 第一 <OR> 军训 </choose> choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Embiid in the new season. 
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> SPF </choose> to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Embiid must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of the 76ers remains a question. 
Last season, 32% of the <choose> score <TO> 得分 <OR> PA </choose> of Okafor came from low position attacks. The ratio is higher than Cousins, Vukcevic and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league. 
With Simmons already showing a good point-forward potential, Embiid also has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor's position is hard to be so solid.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career.
But the problem is, with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's appearance rate will surely decline, which is bound to affect his play.
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's <choose> defense <TO> 防守 <OR> 喷雾 </choose> difficulty. 
Durant's arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of Warriors players, but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward. This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker had a better performance than last season. This is not only because his basket <choose> efficiency <TO> 效率 <OR> 选纯 </choose> came to the highest level, his chemical reaction with Aldrich also benefits the Spurs. 
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battle in a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the <choose> oil <TO> 油 <OR> 防晒 </choose> tank of French sports car is not much left. 
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular MVP than that of James, while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than that of James.
Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in Cleveland in the past 52 years.
Coming to the 14th season of his career, James <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 一次 </choose> to better conserve his strength and get ready for the playoffs. 
Therefore, in the regular season, James's capability is likely to further decline. He will share more with Owen, but he will still easily become one of the league's top three players.
"I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply it to Russia".
Huang Jing, <choose> chairman <TO> 皮肤 <OR> 主席 </choose> of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association said excitedly on the 12th day of the month of the local time while she was interviewed by a reporter of Chinanews.com. 
Not long ago, she participated in the "Overseas Chinese <choose> culture <TO> 最高 <OR> 文化 </choose> community Chinese talent (calligraphy/painting) training" hosted by China's State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and sponsored by Jinan University. 
At the beginning of her participation in the training course, she did not know where to start in painting and calligraphy. But at the end of the course, she could draw and write her own works.
After returning to Moscow, I will use the knowledge and <choose> skills <TO> 技能 <OR> 全球 </choose> learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese culture. 
At the same time, Na Yanwei, Secretary-General of Russian-Chinese Culture Promotion Association, also participated in the training course and had the same feeling.
She said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being an "overseas communicator of Chinese culture".
She said, after she came back to Russia, she would surely carry out the traditional Chinese <choose> culture <TO> 文化 <OR> 引进 </choose> among the Chinese and the Russian peoples who love Chinese culture.

Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday <choose> night <TO> 关系 <OR> 晚上 </choose> when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio. 
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute <choose> strength <TO> 力量 <OR> 煤价 </choose> to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour. 
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, <choose> Argentina <TO> 阿根廷 <OR> 煤矿 </choose> and South Africa along the way. 
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is <choose> Ben <TO> 本 <OR> 过去 </choose> Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon. 
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the <choose> World <TO> 世界 <OR> 第二 </choose> Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner. 
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
<choose> Dan <TO> 进度 <OR> 丹 </choose> Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands. 
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle <choose> Brown <TO> 布朗 <OR> 资金 </choose> put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half. 
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, <choose> brother <TO> 兄弟 <OR> 进行 </choose> of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal. 
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's <choose> cancer <TO> 癌症 <OR> 产能 </choose> battle 
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 <choose> months <TO> 月 <OR> 产能 </choose> ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer. 
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I <choose> needed <TO> 需要 <OR> 充分发挥 </choose> to get paid so I had to get better quickly. 
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the <choose> ward <TO> 加强 <OR> 病房 </choose> - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough. 
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a <choose> journey <TO> 旅程 <OR> 巴西 </choose> but that makes it a bit bigger. 
In the immediacy of victory their <choose> first <TO> 首先 <OR> % </choose> thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties. 
Stanning, a captain in the <choose> Royal <TO> 经济 <OR> 皇家 </choose> Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot." 
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 <choose> metres <TO> 投资 <OR> 米 </choose> when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve. 
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really <choose> important <TO> 投资 <OR> 重要 </choose> not to get carried away. 
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to <choose> enjoy <TO> 几乎 <OR> 享受 </choose> the moment. 
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.

Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 <choose> Months <TO> 月 <OR> 条件 </choose> 
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the <choose> highest <TO> 最高 <OR> 航道 </choose> value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted. 
The annual <choose> average <TO> 平均 <OR> 工程 </choose> inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%. 
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.

Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).

Snapchat "Anime" <choose> Effect <TO> 效果 <OR> 水河 </choose> Is Criticized as Asian Caricature 
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a <choose> dog <TO> 狗 <OR> 航道 </choose> or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting. 
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the <choose> company <TO> 公司 <OR> 溜河 </choose> has with diversity. 
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The <choose> company <TO> 公司 <OR> 进度 </choose> offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people. 
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the <choose> photos <TO> 照片 <OR> 瓶颈 </choose> was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least." 
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only <choose> company <TO> 公司 <OR> 表现 </choose> to cross these cultural tripwires. 
American <choose> culture <TO> 文化 <OR> 刷新 </choose> seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands. 
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is <choose> insulting <TO> 项目 <OR> 侮辱 </choose> to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before." 
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in <choose> hiring <TO> 兴趣 <OR> 招聘 </choose> practices at Snapchat. 
Ms. <choose> Zhu <TO> 朱 <OR> 成为 </choose> criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat. 
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
<choose> Other <TO> 鲜肉 <OR> 其他 </choose> observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered. 
The <choose> company <TO> 公司 <OR> 需要 </choose> does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company. 
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial <choose> backgrounds <TO> 背景 <OR> 运动员 </choose> of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally. 
For her part, Ms. <choose> Zhu <TO> 记住 <OR> 朱 </choose> said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K." 
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> 退役 </choose> Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday. 
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among <choose> Central <TO> 开除 <OR> 中央 </choose> Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State. 
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than <choose> analysis <TO> 分析 <OR> 参加 </choose> produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said. 
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad <choose> analysis <TO> 曾经 <OR> 分析 </choose> is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California. 
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in <choose> Central <TO> 团体冠军 <OR> 中央 </choose> Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces. 
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> 运动员 </choose> Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said. 
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the <choose> control <TO> 控制 <OR> 毕竟 </choose> of the Islamic State. 
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," <choose> Representative <TO> 代表 <OR> 想到 </choose> Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement. 
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> 新人 </choose> Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq. 
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," <choose> Representative <TO> 代表 <OR> 运动 </choose> Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement. 
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or <choose> political <TO> 要求 <OR> 政治 </choose> narrative." 
The <choose> preliminary <TO> 初步 <OR> 心里 </choose> results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast. 
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome <choose> healthy <TO> 健康 <OR> 降低 </choose> dialogue on these vital national security topics." 
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in <choose> Iraq <TO> 线下 <OR> 伊拉克 </choose> and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials). 
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on <choose> Central <TO> 习惯 <OR> 中央 </choose> Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots. 
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a <choose> research <TO> 传输速度 <OR> 研究 </choose> paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion. 
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to <choose> sell <TO> 出售 <OR> 对话 </choose> oil on the black market. 
But the finding was not distributed outside <choose> Central <TO> 中央 <OR> 朋友 </choose> Command, The Times reported in September. 
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin <choose> retired <TO> 退役 <OR> 时间 </choose> in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel. 
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field <choose> hockey <TO> 曲棍球 <OR> 朋友 </choose> team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0. 
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those <choose> people <TO> 人 <OR> 大群里 </choose> who keeps track of their goals. 
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will <choose> avoid <TO> 避免 <OR> 吴言 </choose> the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin. 
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field <choose> hockey <TO> 曲棍球 <OR> 整治 </choose> stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever. 
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a <choose> backhand <TO> 进行 <OR> 反手 </choose> shot from close in. 
<choose> India <TO> 调查 <OR> 印度 </choose> had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge. 
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
The Depressing <choose> Food <TO> 食物 <OR> 营运 </choose> of the Depression, in "A Square Meal" 
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to <choose> lunch <TO> 车辆 <OR> 午餐 </choose> in the Oval Office. 
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy <choose> Fifth <TO> 带来 <OR> 第五 </choose> Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup. 
His menu that day was more humble: deviled <choose> eggs <TO> 蛋 <OR> 内科 </choose> in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding. 
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," <choose> Jane <TO> 珍 <OR> 专家 </choose> Ziegelman said. 
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are <choose> food <TO> 食品 <OR> 先天性 </choose> historians. 
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese <choose> cuisine <TO> 菜 <OR> 皮肤科 </choose> in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard." 
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be <choose> published <TO> 出版 <OR> 今年 </choose> Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression. 
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills <choose> lunch <TO> 不要 <OR> 午餐 </choose> counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929. 
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a <choose> cream <TO> 邱家 <OR> 奶油 </choose> cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley. 
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the <choose> couple <TO> 英语 <OR> 夫妻 </choose> deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating. 
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was <choose> peanut <TO> 战略 <OR> 花生 </choose> loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf. 
They were made from an ingredient and a <choose> cheap <TO> 便宜 <OR> 能够 </choose> thing that stretches the ingredient out. 
<choose> Imagine <TO> 想象 <OR> 时间 </choose> eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner. 
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for <choose> male <TO> 男 <OR> 业务 </choose> farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
It was Americans who had sent <choose> food <TO> 本次 <OR> 食物 </choose> to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty. 
"This was a time when <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> 完成 </choose> became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it. 
Equally fraught was the <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 工作 </choose> budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce. 
Fresh <choose> fruit <TO> 水果 <OR> 地震 </choose> was replaced with cheaper dried fruit. 
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
<choose> Strange <TO> 奇怪 <OR> 民政部门 </choose> mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense. 
In researching the book, which <choose> includes <TO> 包括 <OR> 出席 </choose> recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter. 
"It was not a popular addition to the <choose> dinner <TO> 近千人 <OR> 晚餐 </choose> table," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and <choose> articles <TO> 援助 <OR> 文章 </choose> in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes. 
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to <choose> eat <TO> 吃 <OR> 建博 </choose> Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said. 
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's <choose> hiring <TO> 聘用 <OR> 仪式 </choose> of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared." 
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on <choose> calories <TO> 卡路里 <OR> 正在 </choose> and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking. 
The <choose> couple <TO> 运河 <OR> 夫妻 </choose> said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance. 
"She had a real fear of <choose> food <TO> 食物 <OR> 理论 </choose> waste," Mr. Coe said. 
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got <choose> people <TO> 人 <OR> 自然资源 </choose> sick." 
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, <choose> water <TO> 水 <OR> HKND </choose> and cinnamon. 
<choose> Everyone <TO> 大家 <OR> 家长 </choose> reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo. 
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped <choose> walnuts <TO> 核桃 <OR> 国际性 </choose> would help." 
It is a <choose> pity <TO> 可惜 <OR> ， </choose> that OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high. 
The report cannot prevent the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC. The oil price recovery path is still filled with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC <choose> President <TO> 主席 <OR> 通胀率 </choose> Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry Mohammed Saleh al-Sada said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting at the International Energy Forum on September 26-28. 
The monthly report of OPEC released on Wednesday showed that the July output of the entire OPEC organization, <choose> including <TO> 包括 <OR> 政府 </choose> Gabon, increased by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day. 
OPEC also said in the monthly report that low <choose> crude <TO> 原油 <OR> ， </choose> oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus aggravating the excessive market supply. 
Affected by this news, coupled with the production output expectations of the rising crude oil production volume and the unexpected <choose> increase <TO> 增加 <OR> 国际货币基金组织 </choose> in crude oil inventories, international oil prices fell for two consecutive days. 
As of Wednesday's closing, the futures price of light crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48% while Rondon Brent's price for October crude oil futures fell by 2.07%.
According to Reuters, the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply. The data released by the US Energy Information Administration also dampens the market.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted on Wednesday the speech of <choose> Iranian <TO> 伊朗 <OR> 7 </choose> Oil Minister Zanganeh as saying that Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008. 
As soon as the release of the news of the meeting, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of production freezing negotiations under the current oil price.
It was April when the oil-producing countries had the <choose> last <TO> 上次 <OR> 外部 </choose> meeting. No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries for relevant meaures. 
The market and the media could overreact to OPEC's meeting, according to Emma Richards, an <choose> oil <TO> 石油 <OR> 念头 </choose> and gas analyst at BMI Research. 
OPEC changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would reach an agreement, said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at <choose> Royal <TO> 科大 <OR> 皇家 </choose> Bank of Canada. 
Such a means is just like smoke and mirror that draw people's attention (which deliberately gives a false impression).
It is deemed very unlikely by people that OPEC tries to stabilize the market through the September meeting, according to Eugen Weinberg, director of commodity <choose> research <TO> 研究 <OR> 一家人 </choose> at Commerzbank. 
This will probably further undermine the market <choose> confidence <TO> 信心 <OR> 小时候 </choose> in OPEC. After all, this organization already staged a "wolf is coming" performance. 
All the local authorities should make medical institutions which have had illegal medical advertising, received complaints frequently or been repeatedly punished as the focus of their random inspection.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will timely carry out supervision and examination on the supervision and inspection <choose> work <TO> 工作 <OR> 黄伊琳 </choose> of some provinces. 
According to media disclosure, the large-scale flow of capital into the Internet medicine sector has resulted in the <choose> current <TO> 看上去 <OR> 目前 </choose> serious problem of product homogeneity. Investment boom faded gradually and capital came into the wait-and-see period. 
In addition, according to the data of the Hong Kong Institute of Asclepius Hospital Management, a large number of start-up Internet medical companies languished within one year and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist.
However, just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle on the way of A round or B round of financing, several segment-leading enterprises can still be favored by investors.
It seems that the Internet medical business shall not be blinded. Instead, it should take into account the needs of the market, and should be professional and dedicated.
Yuyue invested RMB 12 million, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, while Jiuzhoutong invested RMB 18 million, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the national <choose> policy <TO> 政策 <OR> 不顾一切 </choose> support for medical information construction, electronic integrated supply chain management systems have gradually been introduced to hospitals at all levels. 
The <choose> cooperation <TO> 合作 <OR> 距离 </choose> between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping the hospital to build an advanced supply chain management system, and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation. 
Unlike many Internet medical <choose> companies <TO> 公司 <OR> 斜坡 </choose> which go in for grandiose projects, iBaby focuses on the Internet obstetrics vertical field and be dedicated to pregnant mothers and doctors. 
Pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-on-one inquiry with doctors, but also enjoy paid medical counseling.
At the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical <choose> restrictions <TO> 限制 <OR> 女士 </choose> by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture, peer exchange, case discussion and so on. 
At present, three sectors are set up for doctor's client side, i.e. continuing education, <choose> social <TO> 社交 <OR> 支持 </choose> exchange and communication. 
Services <choose> including <TO> 包括 <OR> 学霸 </choose> online learning, case discussion, academic exchange, social platforms for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department, legal assistance and business support required by doctor-patient relationship or personal life are provided. 
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said <choose> Ali <TO> 开赛 <OR> 阿里 </choose> Health "is willing to get down" to win big health data. 
Internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism. No unity can be provided even on the wording of the same entry.
The layout of Ali in the medical and <choose> health <TO> 召开 <OR> 健康 </choose> field is divided into three parts, namely, Ali Health, Yaotmall.com and Alipay Future Hospital. 
Wang Lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and <choose> health <TO> 健康 <OR> 各项 </choose> companies to start up than other industries, "This is not just how much money you have. In addition, it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness. " 
Staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
The <choose> Brazil <TO> 举重 <OR> 巴西 </choose> Olympic Games is in full swing. Even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in China, many people will stay up late to watch. 
In this regard, a doctor reminded that staying up late has <choose> health <TO> 比赛 <OR> 健康 </choose> risks and may lead to cardiovascular diseases. 
If you stay up for a long time, a great amount of <choose> hormone <TO> 救护车 <OR> 激素 </choose> will be secreted and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery. This may easily cause vasoconstriction and blood pressure rise and then cardiovascular disease. 
Han Zhiyuan specially reminded people with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors that they may easily suffer from cardiovascular <choose> diseases <TO> 疾病 <OR> 运动 </choose> if staying up late. 
If you stay up late, then your cardiovascular <choose> function <TO> 功能 <OR> 抽调 </choose> will be affected, your gastrointestinal function, immune system and neuroendocrine system will also be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase. 
For old people, Han Zhiyuan suggested that they would better not stay up late to watch games, particularly those with cardiovascular diseases.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Zhiyuan received a 60-year-old patient. His onset of myocardial infarction may be related to staying up late to watch games.
According to Han Zhiyuan, his department had treated some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or stroke patients. This is largely due to staying up late for a long time.
1. Do not stay up late every day. You can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the rebroadcast for other sports the next day.
2. You may drink more water, have more fruit during staying up as this can prevent blood clogging and enhance your body immunity.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transported missiles to Cuba, which almost led to the US-Soviet Union nuclear war.
This <choose> event <TO> 免费 <OR> 事件 </choose> was seen as the climax of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis". 
But what is little known is that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union. The <choose> incident <TO> 事件 <OR> 港交所 </choose> was not been announced by researchers until August 9. 
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military force in the Arctic.
These radars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US, used for monitoring Soviet missiles.
This paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado, who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and <choose> analysis <TO> 积极 <OR> 分析 </choose> of solar activity and reviewed non-confidential documents. 
The paper said that in the 1960s, in order to <choose> prevent <TO> 防止 <OR> 数量 </choose> the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the US Air Force has always had some fighters flying in the sky with nuclear warheads. 
US military commanders did not know that the chief culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state.
Fortunately, the US military force had started the <choose> study <TO> 河南省 <OR> 研究 </choose> of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the Earth since the 1950s, it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict. 
Later, he summarized the information <choose> provided <TO> 提供 <OR> 发送 </choose> by the US Air Force Air Weather Service and submitted a detailed report. 
The <choose> direct <TO> 直接 <OR> 发送 </choose> consequences of this solar storm was that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern since then and has built a stronger space weather forecast system.

US Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani <choose> attended <TO> 鲸鱼 <OR> 出席 </choose> the press conference in New York on that day. 
This is the <choose> fifth <TO> 鲨鱼 <OR> 第五次 </choose> time that China's civilian think tank has published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth issue of the English version. 
The report is divided into nine chapters, <choose> including <TO> 包括 <OR> 汇率 </choose> overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, military system reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on. 
According to the report, the year 2015 is the last year of the <choose> Abe <TO> 安倍 <OR> 美元 </choose> government's multiple-year push to promote major policy adjustments in the security field. 
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system, strategy implementation, <choose> policy <TO> 汇改 <OR> 政策 </choose> implementation and other operational levels, rather than the substantial adjustments and changes of framework, mechanisms and policies. 
The report emphasized that the <choose> Abe <TO> 贬值 <OR> 安倍 </choose> Cabinet tried to achieve the promotion of Japan's "state normalization" via the above-mentioned three breakthroughs and the going-out of militia to intervene in international security affairs, strengthen the Japan-US alliance, prevent the rise of China and restrain China.

The Supplement of Public Sports Facilities
A dark coal yard warehouse is turned into a "green grass" football field while red brick spire plant is turned into a modern stadium.
Nanluo Maying Sports Culture Park, located outside the <choose> Hangzhou <TO> 杭州 <OR> 过高 </choose> Wangjiang gate, unveiled its mysterious veil on the national fitness day. 
It was once a coal yard and had been idle for more than 10 years after its closure. A large number of illegal construction and <choose> garbage <TO> 垃圾 <OR> 进出口 </choose> were left behind. 
After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to <choose> provide <TO> 提供 <OR> 贸易顺差 </choose> sports venues. In addition, it would undoubtedly open up a new sports venue for the national sports. 
This reminds <choose> people <TO> 人 <OR> 警方 </choose> of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sports School, which is a "Whampoa Military Academy" in China's swimming world, giving birth to several world champions. 
Swimming champions will be produced continuously, producing a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports. The profound mass base will be good for selecting professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the national foundation of sports. Athletic sports depend in a certain sense on the national sports, and the national sports depend on the conditions of the venues .
According to reports, as of 2015, China's per capita area of sports venues has been 150 times of that when the <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 一同 </choose> China was established, but still far lagged behind the world sports powers. 
The State Council issued the "National <choose> Fitness <TO> 健身 <OR> 栅栏 </choose> Program (2016 - 2020)" and took the development of mass sports as a key content this June. 
In order to make up for the weakness, on the one hand, the relevant departments shall take full account of the distribution of the stadiums in urban planning.
On the other hand, the already built public sports venues, <choose> including <TO> 涉案 <OR> 包括 </choose> sports venues in schools and other organizations, should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible. 
The Rio Olympic Games, which is being held, is rousing people's enthusiasm for sports and their sense of participation as well.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district <choose> judge <TO> 法官 <OR> 应当 </choose> has ruled. 
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. <choose> judge <TO> 法官 <OR> 之声 </choose> found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices. 
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District <choose> Judge <TO> 法官 <OR> 本次 </choose> Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case. 
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of <choose> hepatitis <TO> 肝炎 <OR> 引起 </choose> C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. 
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory <choose> work <TO> 工作 <OR> 派遣 </choose> underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs. 
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full <choose> control <TO> 控制 <OR> 年代 </choose> of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday. 
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our <choose> control <TO> 重要 <OR> 控制 </choose> but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters. 
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her <choose> husband <TO> 塞拉利昂 <OR> 丈夫 </choose> had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. 
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in <choose> charitable <TO> 慈善 <OR> 外相 </choose> contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department. 
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign <choose> aide <TO> 助手 <OR> 援助 </choose> Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. 
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by <choose> law <TO> 法律 <OR> 一是 </choose> to do so. 
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a <choose> reason <TO> 理由 <OR> 工作 </choose> for his refusal to release his returns. 
"Your move," Clinton campaign <choose> aide <TO> 助手 <OR> 相对 </choose> Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns. 
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his <choose> charitable <TO> 慈善 <OR> 小泉 </choose> contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia. 
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans <choose> urging <TO> 意图 <OR> 敦促 </choose> Trump to release his taxes. 
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday <choose> quoted <TO> 引用 <OR> 目标 </choose> a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case. 
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an <choose> average <TO> 平均 <OR> 法院 </choose> effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent. 
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their <choose> main <TO> 主要 <OR> 船员 </choose> investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker slams <choose> Berlin <TO> 柏林 <OR> 海事局 </choose> hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News 
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol <choose> hotel <TO> 财产 <OR> 酒店 </choose> in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers. 
Claude Lanzmann, an <choose> author <TO> 作者 <OR> 本期 </choose> of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ. 
During his <choose> recent <TO> 带来 <OR> 最近 </choose> stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel. 
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the <choose> capital <TO> 首都 <OR> 全方位 </choose> of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated? 
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial <choose> Israel <TO> 全球 <OR> 以色列 </choose> via an own call center. 
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The <choose> answer <TO> 回答 <OR> 开幕 </choose> he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him." 
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The <choose> reason <TO> 汹涌 <OR> 理由 </choose> behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker. 
"The majority of our <choose> guests <TO> 客人 <OR> 兰胜会 </choose> are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann. 
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very <choose> hotel <TO> 酒店 <OR> 抢孤 </choose> chain, is an even greater disgrace. 
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the <choose> hotel <TO> 酒店 <OR> 人士 </choose> draws the right conclusions," the official said. 
The <choose> incident <TO> 活动 <OR> 事件 </choose> triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal. 
Some alleged that the Kempinski <choose> hotel <TO> 特别 <OR> 酒店 </choose> simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers. 
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The <choose> hotel <TO> 酒店 <OR> 手艺 </choose> itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports. 
"There was never a <choose> direct <TO> 直接 <OR> 布置 </choose> order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying. 
It adds that the code was now added.
<choose> Police <TO> 活动 <OR> 警方 </choose> use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students 
Students clashed with <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 队伍 </choose> in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system. 
<choose> Police <TO> 潮人盂 <OR> 警方 </choose> used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters. 
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 京剧 </choose> using rubber bullets and tear gas. 
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly <choose> sixth <TO> 第六 <OR> 重点 </choose> at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired. 
The issue between <choose> Beijing <TO> 北京 <OR> 时而 </choose> and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff. 
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both <choose> Beijing <TO> 文化 <OR> 北京 </choose> and London. 
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also <choose> born <TO> 白娘子 <OR> 出生 </choose> on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver. 
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on <choose> today <TO> 今天 <OR> 理解 </choose> and plays out over three days. 
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified <choose> fastest <TO> 中墨 <OR> 最快 </choose> in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit. 
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's <choose> second <TO> 第二 <OR> 三亚 </choose> day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus. 
He had a dispute with commissaires <choose> yesterday <TO> 昨天 <OR> 充分肯定 </choose> ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height. 
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at <choose> Beijing <TO> 北京 <OR> 紧紧抓住 </choose> and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio. 
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in <choose> April <TO> 带头作用 <OR> 四月 </choose> amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton. 
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
After the <choose> little <TO> 小 <OR> 特色 </choose> baby came to this world, Mom and Dad shall be responsible for his life, not only for his health, but also his spirit development, i.e. education. 
If such <choose> education <TO> 王路 <OR> 教育 </choose> failed, then no matter how successful the parent's career is, one cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure. 
When a new baby is born, the new parents <choose> need <TO> 中国 <OR> 需要 </choose> to spend time in taking care of and educating it, and be responsible for it. 
And responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body, making them healthy, but also the <choose> education <TO> 正厅级 <OR> 教育 </choose> of spirit. That is, to make children learn how to behave, grow up and succeed. 
High-quality family education means that <choose> parents <TO> 父母 <OR> 国内 </choose> often need to accompany their children, take care of them patiently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence. 
Parents' words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will <choose> imitate <TO> 模仿 <OR> 无限 </choose> their parents. And that is the so called, "like father, like son". 
So the <choose> parent <TO> 父母 <OR> 选择 </choose> need to be a good example in front of children, regulate our words, cultivate our characters, which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character and make them more excellent.

However, when the task is <choose> heavy <TO> 退步 <OR> 重 </choose> and pressing, Amy feels very painful and torturous. 
The individual's <choose> resistance <TO> 抵抗 <OR> 得分 </choose> to self-exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from threatening. 
And some behaviorist psychologists regard the resistance as an individual's disobedience to their behavioral corrections.

Uber caused a big impact on the local traditional taxi industry four years after joining the Taiwanese market.
According to the information of Taiwan's "United Daily News" on August 12, more than 100 taxies drove around Taiwan Executive Yuan for protest in the morning. This resulted in a serious <choose> traffic <TO> 交通 <OR> NBA </choose> tie-up in the surrounding area. 
It has been four years since the arrival of Uber in Taiwan, but the authorities did not launch any meeting until the end of this month. This made drivers cannot wait any more, said Zheng Lijia, chairman of <choose> Taipei <TO> 台北市 <OR> 奥卡福 </choose> Driver Union. 
However, the <choose> government <TO> 使用率 <OR> 政府 </choose> failed to keep faith and delayed again and again. 
The law-abiding taxi drivers, who are at the bottom of the society, had to compete with the unrestrained Uber and felt that they were deceived by the authorities.

After the verdict came into effect, the person surnamed Li did not voluntarily <choose> fulfill <TO> 影响 <OR> 履行 </choose> the obligation determined by the verdict, so another person surnamed Wang applied for enforcement to the Shuyang court. 
On October 16, 2014, the Shuyang <choose> court <TO> 法院 <OR> 球员 </choose> made a civil ruling, which ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying hens shall be seized and shall not be transferred or sold without permission. 
After receiving the distrain ruling, Li sold some of the egg laying hens without the permission of the Shuyang court.
On March 8, 2015, when Shuyang County's Public Security Bureau came for an inspection, there were only 142 layers on the farm.
Journalists learned on August 12 that the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games issued a notice that the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games would inherit the emblem and signs and other intellectual property rights of the Bid Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.
Without the permission of the <choose> Beijing <TO> 牺牲 <OR> 北京 </choose> Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, no one is allowed to use the emblem and signs of the Bid Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games for commercial purposes. 
The head of the Department of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and <choose> Reform <TO> 改革 <OR> 效率 </choose> Commission pointed out today that iron and steel overcapacity becomes a global problem. 
China's capacity utilization in recent years was higher than the <choose> global <TO> 跑车 <OR> 全球 </choose> average, and also higher than that of countries like the United States and those in Europe. 
China has taken resolute and <choose> effective <TO> 有效 <OR> 常规赛 </choose> measures to resolve excess capacity, and the achievements are gradually made. 
The CPC Central Committee and the State Council attached great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity, according to the person in charge.
All departments and regions have actively implemented the <choose> deployment <TO> 部署 <OR> 年里 </choose> of the State Council, earnestly carried out the work, and reduced crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year. 
In view of China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. Instead, it takes a series of practical <choose> measures <TO> 詹姆斯 <OR> 措施 </choose> to control steel exports. 
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products was essentially a market behavior and an independent choice due to the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures cannot help fundamentally solve the <choose> global <TO> 全球 <OR> 轻松 </choose> steel industry development problems. On the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order. 
When it comes to debt, the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the <choose> important <TO> 俄罗斯 <OR> 重要 </choose> issues that need proper handling. 
As the iron and steel enterprises are large-scale and involve a wide range of enterprises and the debt relationship is complex, it may lead to regional risks if disposed of improperly.
In recent years, with the increasing economic downward pressure, the total social demand gradually weakened, the utilization of some industry capacity decreased and enterprise production, operation and management difficulties increased, according to the person in charge.
Some enterprises find it difficult for them to sustain and some of them are even on the brink of collapse due to their failure to adapt to the market changes. However, restrained by some institutional factors, they are unable to withdraw and become "zombie enterprises"
The <choose> existence <TO> 莫斯科 <OR> 存在 </choose> of these companies distorted the market signals, reduced the element resources utilization efficiency, increased the cost of social management, thereby hindering the establishment of a market environment based on fair competition. 
The <choose> main <TO> 中国 <OR> 主要 </choose> reasons for the loss are the same as the dilemma confronted by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization rate. 
China mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law approaches. The <choose> government <TO> 政府 <OR> 作品 </choose> is mainly doing the work of providing primary protection to workers and keeping social stability to ensure a fair and equitable market order. 
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good <choose> job <TO> 这一 <OR> 工作 </choose> to ensure overcapacity reduction and ensuring the achievement of the objective of reducing 100-150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years. 
On the <choose> afternoon <TO> 下午 <OR> 老师 </choose> of the 10th day of the month, the appearance of Chinese tourism police at the Red Square in Moscow immediately drew people's attention. Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and the local people and foreign tourists cannot help but stopping and looking back. 
On the same day, China's first professional tourism police team - members of the Tourism <choose> Police <TO> 警察 <OR> 回俄后 </choose> Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Sanya City, Hainan Province, came to the Red Square in Moscow for experience exchange and study with the local tourism police on duty. 
<choose> Moscow <TO> 北京国安 <OR> 莫斯科 </choose> tourism police are divided into three groups for patrol at the Red Square, Nicolieski Pedestrian Street and Gum Department Store. The Chinese tourism police followed them for study. The whole process lasted for more than an hour. 
Liu Xinie, an female police officer who is over 20 years old, is proficient in English and Spanish. She just <choose> joined <TO> 加入 <OR> 国安 </choose> the tourism police team last year. 
He carefully observed every word and action of his Russian counterpart and communicated with her from time to time.
The <choose> Moscow <TO> 飞扑 <OR> 莫斯科 </choose> tourism police explained to the visitors with fluent Spanish whenever a Spanish tourist came for consultation. This greatly impressed Wang Bing. 
"Every <choose> Moscow <TO> 莫斯科 <OR> 旧主 </choose> tourism policeman masters a foreign language, and some even can speak more than two languages, which impressed us a lot." 
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to <choose> attracting <TO> 吸引 <OR> 禁区 </choose> international tourists. We hope to improve their ability to match the status of the international tourism island." 
Before the study, the Chinese tourism police also went to the brigade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counterparts that day.
"I often answer questions of Chinese tourists and I am very happy to see them travel to Russia."
"Their usual questions are: How to get to somewhere? Where a certain monument is? How to rent a <choose> taxi <TO> 出租 <OR> 卡尔德 </choose> and how to return to the hotel." 
Lei Sakov, the brigade captain of the <choose> Moscow <TO> 莫斯科 <OR> 攻门 </choose> city police said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism ambience have become better and better, attracting more and more foreign tourists. 
In order to meet the <choose> needs <TO> 需要 <OR> 情绪 </choose> of tourism development, a tourism police team was established in July 2014 to be responsible for patrol in the major scenic spots, thus helping and guiding the tourists. 
At present, all <choose> Moscow <TO> 梅茨 <OR> 莫斯科 </choose> tourism policemen are proficient in English and some also master Spanish and German. 
The <choose> police <TO> 警察 <OR> 禁区 </choose> brigade divided them into nine groups according to their foreign language levels. They have two classes per week, learning self-defense moves, laws, regulations and foreign languages. 
"At present, there are two tourism policemen beginning to learn Chinese and they can speak fluently. We have to continue to improve their Chinese level," Lysakov said.
Lysakov told reporters that the <choose> Moscow <TO> 力帆 <OR> 莫斯科 </choose> Tourism Police has accumulated experience since its inception. He hoped this will inspire his counterparts in Sanya. 
He believes that the <choose> cooperation <TO> 目前 <OR> 合作 </choose> between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security sense of their citizens to each other's national tourism. 
"The recruiting, police <choose> mode <TO> 亚洲 <OR> 模式 </choose> and equipment of Moscow tourism police officers and their excellent interactions with visitors have inspired us a lot." Chen Xiaokun said. 
Detailed rules for the implementation of residence permit have been issued by at least nine provinces and cities, i.e. Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, <choose> Fujian <TO> 德甲联赛 <OR> 福建 </choose> and Beijing, according to journalists of chinanews.com. 
The above regions generally stipulated that applicants for the residence permit shall live locally for more than six months and meet one of these three requirements: having legitimate and stable employment, having legal and stable residence and having conditions for continuous study.
In the aspect of conveniences brought by residence permit, the "gold content" is different in various cities. Compared with the national provisions, some areas have <choose> provided <TO> 提供 <OR> 本次 </choose> more public services and conveniences, according to Chinanews.com journalists. 
These areas have <choose> increased <TO> 增加 <OR> 赛事 </choose> the conveniences for children to attend the college entrance examination locally after meeting the related requirements. 
In addition, it is clearly proposed by <choose> Beijing <TO> 联赛 <OR> 北京 </choose> and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and conveniences, and regularly release the new scope to the community. 
For example, <choose> Fujian <TO> 中国 <OR> 福建 </choose> proposed to announce the public services and conveniences for residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years. 
The Residence Permit Provisional Regulations provide that, for those in line with the residence permit conditions, the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of application acceptance.
For the time limit of the permit issuance, most of the regions hold the same opinion with the national version, i.e, within 15 days.
<choose> Hebei <TO> 河北 <OR> 优酷 </choose> clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance. 
<choose> Jiangxi <TO> 江西 <OR> 斐济 </choose> stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the public security department shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance. 
In accordance with the "residence permit provisional regulations", the above cities stipulate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be exempted in case of initial application of the residence permit.
For example, <choose> Sichuan <TO> 四川 <OR> 延续 </choose> required the local police stations or commissioned community service agencies to strictly enforce the approved fee and charge standard and resolutely prohibit over-range or over-standard fees or charge bundling. 
It was found that on July 27, 2016, that Chen Yangxia, the former Party secretary of Dingnan County, Ganzhou City, came to the Provincial Commission of Discipline Inspection to take office and served as director of the CPC supervision room (deputy director-general level with a one-year probation period).
The red wine at the dinner of that day was <choose> provided <TO> 提供 <OR> 回避 </choose> by Li Youcai while other costs were borne by another person surnamed Liu. 
The Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziliang, who organized and <choose> accepted <TO> 接受 <OR> 银牌 </choose> dining invitations in private clubs, violated the spirit of the central Party committee's eight provisions and the Party's discipline. 
Pogba was punished with two yellow cards in last season's Coppa Italia, which automatically results in a one-game ban according to the rules.
Although he has transferred back to the FA Premier League, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) still passes his accumulative suspension to the FA Cup.
In this way, on August 14, in the away games of fighting against Bournemouth, Pogba will watch a fight without helping any party. His first show after return to Manchester United will be postponed to the Southampton home game on August 20.
As the No.12 <choose> rookie <TO> 新秀 <OR> 状态 </choose> of the first round in 2014, Saric will officially land on the NBA in the next season, and join the Philadelphia 76ers. 
As a young European player, Saric is not known to many fans. But I believe he impressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games.
In a game with win by a narrow margin of Croatia over Spain, Saric successfully blocked Pau Gasol's try to drag the game into an overtime inside shot.
Recently, Brett Brown, head coach of the 76ers, gave Saric a <choose> high <TO> 高 <OR> 英国队 </choose> rating. The Spurs head coach thought he saw the spirit of the young Manu Ginobili in Saric. 
It is quite clear that Saric already showed his gift and made the 76ers full of expectations on him.
In Croatia's first two games at this year's Olympic Games, Saric achieved a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his <choose> capability <TO> 能力 <OR> 成绩 </choose> of making space in the field. He can have a shot outside the three-point line via the pick and roll with his teammates. 
Although the <choose> current <TO> 阿德莱 <OR> 目前 </choose> 76ers is packed with many gifted inside young players, they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as Saric. 
From block shot to a long-pass fast break and achievement of assists, there are just a few insiders who can make it in the NBA field.
Since the beginning of this year's Olympic Games, Saric has obtained 13 points, eight rebounds and five <choose> assists <TO> 打击 <OR> 助攻 </choose> in each of the three games, with a perfect performance. 
James has signed two 1 + 1 <choose> contracts <TO> 合同 <OR> 杰瑞 </choose> since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014. 
Now, as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice <choose> chairman <TO> 碰到 <OR> 主席 </choose> of the NBA player union. 
The substantial increase in union <choose> revenue <TO> 收入 <OR> 右角 </choose> is attributed to the new television protocol. The question is how the boss and players deal with the money. The outside world is worried that the NBA will come to a standstill in the next summer. 
But for James, he will not have to worry about the possibility of becoming a <choose> free <TO> 自由 <OR> 上半场 </choose> player next summer because he has renewed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers. 
No matter when the 2017-18 season will officially kick off, James is within the contract.
Since the stunning debut of iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market also ushered in a <choose> small <TO> 瓦特 <OR> 小 </choose> screen mobile phone boom. 
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first work of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
NubiaZ11mini follows the consistent photographed gene, and is equipped with a one-hand easier-to-hold 5.0-inch screen and convenient and easy-to-use back fingerprint recognition, contributing to its superior <choose> use <TO> 已经 <OR> 使用 </choose> experience. 
Z11mini, a small screen camera phone which was just <choose> listed <TO> 上市 <OR> 橄榄球 </choose> by Nubia, had a price fall of RMB 200, decreasing from the original RMB 1,499 to RMB 1,299. 
In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen. The classic "little red circle" design is at the <choose> bottom <TO> 下方 <OR> 情况 </choose> of the obverse side. 
The middle frame is made of metal material. Its <choose> bottom <TO> 底部 <OR> 再次 </choose> adopts symmetrical design and is equipped with a Type-C data interface. 
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power <choose> contract <TO> 合同 <OR> 比分 </choose> 
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of <choose> workers <TO> 工人 <OR> 表现 </choose> - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed. 
The move follows the decision of the Victoria <choose> government <TO> 政府 <OR> 无所谓 </choose> earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation. 
A 20-year <choose> fixed <TO> 固定 <OR> 完败 </choose> subsidy expires in November. 
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - <choose> direct <TO> 下半场 <OR> 直接 </choose> and indirect - could be at risk with any closure. 
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last <choose> year <TO> 最终 <OR> 年 </choose> of the Anglesea power plant. 
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp <choose> holding <TO> 最让人 <OR> 持有 </choose> smaller shares. 
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical <choose> demand <TO> 看到 <OR> 需求 </choose> for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said. 
AGL said the <choose> contracts <TO> 合同 <OR> 帮助 </choose> are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016. 
The <choose> contracts <TO> 到来 <OR> 合同 </choose> have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017. 
"As such, AGL continues to expect the <choose> contracts <TO> 合同 <OR> 膀胱癌 </choose> to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said. 
Any potential <choose> earnings <TO> 收入 <OR> 不 </choose> impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices. 
AGL said it had already written down the value of the <choose> contracts <TO> 合同 <OR> 多 </choose> in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event." 
Alcoa said the decision to close out the <choose> contracts <TO> 合同 <OR> 这会 </choose> "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter." 
The US <choose> company <TO> 公司 <OR> 降到 </choose> said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract. 
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in <choose> demand <TO> 激励 <OR> 需求量 </choose> in the [electricity] market. 
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five <choose> people <TO> 人 <OR> 走上 </choose> - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation. 
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From <choose> June <TO> 六月 <OR> 一次 </choose> next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding. 
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the <choose> latest <TO> 金牌 <OR> 最新 </choose> National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year. 
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of <choose> people <TO> 反复 <OR> 人 </choose> are turned away from the vital services they need," he said. 
<choose> People <TO> 人 <OR> 这是 </choose> leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need. 
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be <choose> forced <TO> 被迫 <OR> 非常感谢 </choose> to navigate complex legal problems without help. 
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they <choose> need <TO> 对手 <OR> 需要 </choose> when they're faced with a legal problem. 
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the <choose> needs <TO> 需求 <OR> 大量 </choose> of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work. 
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The <choose> incident <TO> 事件 <OR> 惊心动魄 </choose> was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign. 
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other <choose> people <TO> 保持 <OR> 人 </choose> had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing. 
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second <choose> Amendment <TO> 修正案 <OR> 非常 </choose> people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges. 
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic <choose> spirit <TO> 精神 <OR> 今天 </choose> and expand Heathrow 
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our <choose> local <TO> 本地 <OR> 电视 </choose> communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport. 
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 <choose> new <TO> 享受 <OR> 新 </choose> jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK. 
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of <choose> private <TO> 私人 <OR> 一场 </choose> investment. 
The London 2012 Games were a great <choose> success <TO> 我用 <OR> 成功 </choose> for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too. 
It is time for us to channel that Olympic <choose> spirit <TO> 这是 <OR> 精神 </choose> and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of. 
Lord Paul Deighton is <choose> chairman <TO> 过去 <OR> 主席 </choose> of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury 
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The <choose> victim <TO> 受害者 <OR> 表示 </choose> was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night. 
<choose> Police <TO> 警方 <OR> 图书馆 </choose> are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide. 
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the <choose> road <TO> 观众们 <OR> 公路 </choose> "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement. 
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles <choose> including <TO> 图片 <OR> 包括 </choose> a lorry. 
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it <choose> possible <TO> 可能 <OR> Art </choose> to avoid impact? 
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each <choose> case <TO> 仙人掌 <OR> 案件 </choose> - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper. 
Last <choose> year <TO> 一次 <OR> 年 </choose> a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014. 
The 22-year-old <choose> victim <TO> 受害者 <OR> 新书 </choose> had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard. 
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the <choose> road <TO> 公路 <OR> 通货膨胀 </choose> was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said. 
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call <choose> police <TO> 警方 <OR> 通货膨胀率 </choose> on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44. 
NASA climate model: <choose> Venus <TO> 金星 <OR> 消费者 </choose> was once habitable 
<choose> Venus <TO> 相比 <OR> 金星 </choose> was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model. 
Scientists at NASA's Goddard <choose> Institute <TO> 研究所 <OR> 通货膨胀率 </choose> for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists. 
The <choose> model <TO> 模型 <OR> 酒店 </choose> was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions. 
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the <choose> latest <TO> 最新 <OR> 天然气 </choose> simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly. 
The <choose> model <TO> 模型 <OR> Snapchat </choose> also looked at the topography of early Venus. 
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough <choose> water <TO> 水 <OR> 灵感 </choose> and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation. 
<choose> Early <TO> 早期 <OR> 亿名 </choose> Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer. 
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two <choose> months <TO> 月 <OR> 罗伊 </choose> at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release. 
This warms the surface and produces <choose> rain <TO> 雨水 <OR> 多万张 </choose> that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. 
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The <choose> model <TO> 模型 <OR> 注意 </choose> produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists. 
Though likely once habitable, <choose> Venus <TO> 应用 <OR> 金星 </choose> was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light. 
Its <choose> oceans <TO> 海洋 <OR> 多样性 </choose> evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light. 
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the <choose> Venus <TO> Snapchat <OR> 金星 </choose> we know today. 
Researchers shared the results of their <choose> new <TO> 种族主义 <OR> 新 </choose> Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
Patrick Roy resigns as <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 <OR> 其他人 </choose> coach 
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado <choose> Avalanche <TO> 难受 <OR> 雪崩 </choose> on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process. 
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 讽刺 </choose> coach immediately. 
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 <OR> 贬低 </choose> with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement. 
I have thought long and hard over the course of the <choose> summer <TO> 夏季 <OR> 包容性 </choose> about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level. 
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 <OR> 注重 </choose> in 2013-14. 
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the <choose> first <TO> 难逃 <OR> 第一 </choose> round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years. 
The <choose> Avalanche <TO> 雪崩 <OR> 产品 </choose> posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.

North Sea oil <choose> workers <TO> 工人 <OR> 大多数 </choose> resume talks, suspend strike 
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil <choose> workers <TO> 工人 <OR> 没有 </choose> are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said. 
Strikes against <choose> oilfield <TO> 油田 <OR> 投诉 </choose> services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell. 
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have <choose> agreed <TO> 同意 <OR> 负责 </choose> to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read. 
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their <choose> recent <TO> 这一 <OR> 近期 </choose> action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent. 
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea <choose> contractors <TO> 承包商 <OR> 表示 </choose> by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures. 
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent <choose> decrease <TO> 情况 <OR> 降低 </choose> for onshore contractors in 2014. 
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British <choose> energy <TO> 能源 <OR> 工作 </choose> company BG Group. 
<choose> Energy <TO> 美国 <OR> 能源 </choose> companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union. 
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we <choose> need <TO> 需要 <OR> 分析 </choose> an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement. 
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 战士 </choose> projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years. 
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The <choose> latest <TO> 延伸 <OR> 最新 </choose> mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster. 
The <choose> new <TO> 新 <OR> 方面 </choose> data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation. 
"We <choose> hope <TO> 希望 <OR> 分析员 </choose> that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release. 
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The <choose> latest <TO> 摩苏尔 <OR> 最新 </choose> catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars. 
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the <choose> fastest <TO> 最快 <OR> 表示 </choose> rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull. 
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an <choose> ideal <TO> 高层 <OR> 理想 </choose> cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates. 
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical <choose> models <TO> 模型 <OR> 发现 </choose> of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull. 
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their <choose> latest <TO> 长期 <OR> 最新 </choose> analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal. 
According to Zheng Jianjun, the <choose> Management <TO> 公布 <OR> 管理 </choose> Section Chief of Nanhu Park Water Area, the deepest point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep. People who do not understand the situation of the water are probably confronted with danger. 
"Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still <choose> hope <TO> 发布 <OR> 希望 </choose> that the majority of rowing tourists will wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely." Zheng Jianjun said. 
Weitou Village boasts a unique marine environment, with two leisure travel resources including natural ecology and cultural ecology.
"However, several owners who bought the parking lots in the community feared that this would affect the price of their parking space and thought that others may be selfish, so they had been plotting for bad things. This had shelved the parking space transformation. "
As for the question about when the sweet potatoes are introduced and by whom, there are still many different views in the academic community.
According to the <choose> current <TO> 目前 <OR> 分析员 </choose> mainstream view, there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet potato. 
Among the three lines of <choose> introducing <TO> 引入 <OR> 中央 </choose> sweet potato, the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and the widest spread. 
The <choose> Beijing <TO> 北京市 <OR> 国防部 </choose> Municipal Social Organization Management Office will soon carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts for social organization membership fees . 
The inspections will be divided into two categories, i.e. unit self-examination and spot inspection.
A responsible person of the municipal social organization office said that the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received unified receipts for social group fees in the office between 2013 and 2015.
"The <choose> success <TO> 伊拉克 <OR> 成功 </choose> of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media," said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the Olympic Games communication strategy in 2012. 
From the news reports of the Olympic Games, all media have made a lot of big changes in the aspect of mode of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects.
It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the <choose> world <TO> 世界 <OR> 大程度 </choose> will have to meet this round of challenges. 
August 11 was the last <choose> day <TO> 日 <OR> 几乎 </choose> for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares. A source said that there is nothing special in the market response during the first two days of the IPO. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18. 
A domestic brokerage analyst said that Orient Securities did not enjoy a good foundation in Hong Kong. Only the capital management business is its strength. It has many inherent problems compared with bank-type brokers like Bank of China International and CITIC Securities.
Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness, many brokers sagged this year in results. But the situations of securities firms after their <choose> listing <TO> 上市 <OR> 关键 </choose> are dependent on the detailed development performance of their businesses and cannot be generalized. 
With the introduction of this new regulation, Suzhou will become the first second-tier <choose> city <TO> 恐怖组织 <OR> 城市 </choose> to restart the purchase restriction. 
In addition to Suzhou, other second-tier <choose> cities <TO> 城市 <OR> 这一 </choose> including Hefei and Nanjing will also introduce property market regulations and control policies. 
Prior to that, Hefei had come the first to issue restrictions on lending policy. For people who have two apartments in Hefei and have one outstanding housing loan, they will be denied by banks in applying for mortgage services.
